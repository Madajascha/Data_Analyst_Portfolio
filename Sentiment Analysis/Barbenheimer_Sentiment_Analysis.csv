"Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the ""strong"" woman.1,190 out of 1,646 found this helpful.

"Barbie begins in an irresistible way, as a fun dismantling of all the plasticized and body image ideals the doll has set for little girls throughout the decades, as Barbie faces an existential crisis and must journey into the real world to find her true self. Then about halfway through America Ferrera shows up as a dissatisfied Barbie designer and starts hammering us about the patriarchy, as if all men were clueless, macho oafs like Ken that needed to be smugly tolerated by the greater hierarchy of women. Gerwig seems to be projecting her issues about Hollywood and it makes Barbie out of touch.804 out of 1,173 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6,Barbie
"Wow, this movie was a love letter to cinema. From the Kubrick reference at the opening, to the soundstage being 100% real - no cgi for the sets. There were dance sequences like in the olden days (think Grease) and the costuming , wow the costuming. Greta Gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way. The casting director also nailed it, everyone was wonderful.The acting was perfection, I loved seeing the variety of Barbie's on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences, this has to be a voluntary PG13 rating as there wasn't swearing or nudity. There was one beach fight amongst the Kens but that's not really violence compared to today's average films, no one was harmed nor any fake blood used.I actually didn't like the ending at all, and I was quite annoyed that Rhea Perlman played the creator of Barbie but made two quips about the IRS getting her for tax evasion - something Ruth Handler never dealt with. Her problem was with the SEC after she had signed off on a positive Mattel earnings forecast when they knew they were in a down quarter - how's that so tough to explain?Irregardless, I want to see this movie again. And again. And again.20 out of 26 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9,Barbie
"8.5 While i'm not so sure at first, the movie kept getting even more fun, entertaining, and definitely better, also surprisingly deal with a legit serious stuff, Barbie is a weirdly fun movie that fills with this very interesting concept, definitely the first time that's ever done, Greta Gerwig has created this whole new style of filmmaking specifically for Barbie, from the intentionally weird yet creative editing, some awkward and cringe scene, i found the comedy so funny instead of cringe, Barbie is one of the most original movie of the year and also one of the most original movie i've seen in a while, we all know Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is gonna carry the movie and they are, but Will Ferrell, Simu Liu, and the whole rest of the cast were also great and entertaining, the soundtrack was just great, except Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice ""Barbie World"" song that are just absolutely terrible, but Billie Eilish ""What Was I Made For?"" tune that kept haunting in the background until it finally get the perfect scene to played it was really the best thing because that song was just beautiful and emotional, anyway, Barbie is a lot of fun, while there is still some noticeable flawed, most of them i found it funny, entertaining, colourful, creative, and fun, pure fun, it's something that i probably will love it even more the second time i see it, but as of right now, Barbie was a good time, definitely recommended and with this movie somehow it's actually possible to have a live-action Barbie movie, all you need to have is a good writer, good director, and good cast, and they delivers mostly.535 out of 1,231 found this helpful.

"I was honestly doubting this movie at first, but surprisingly I find myself really liking it quite a lot.Set in the colorful Barbie Land, stereotypical Barbie lives a perfect life every single day. One day, she shows signs of being...a human. She decides to go to the Real World to find the cure in order to make herself perfect again.Barbie is a fun movie that has surprisingly plenty of heartwarming moments and good messages to offer. The set designs are eye-catching and on point as well. Both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling nailed their parts, but it is Gosling who mostly shines.Something I'm pretty sure of is this movie getting nominated for the Oscars, most likely for Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and probably Best Song for Billie Eilish. That song is beautiful and it's stuck in my head right now.416 out of 965 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8,Barbie
"The first thing you need to know about Barbie is that Ryan Gosling is the best part of the entire film. For the duration he is over the top, dumb and hilarious. Every scene he was in had me laughing and I enjoyed just about everything he did in the film.Margot Robbie is a great choice for Barbie and as usual puts in a fantastic performance. She hit pretty much every mark in my opinion and I can't see anyone taking her place in this role.Where the film falls flat unfortunately is not the characters, actors or even humour for that matter. It's the incessant political lecturing.It's no surprise that this film takes a strong feminist angle. That's to expected. Barbie was a doll that portrayed many different professions in an attempt to show young girls that they could strive for me than what they were told they could do. But that was the 1950s. This is 2023.By no means is the world a perfect representation of equality today, but it is so vastly superior in that category than it ever has been that the theme of the film falls a little flat. Telling young girls to go after their dreams and not be beholden to any stereotypes is a positive, wonderful message and one that could've been portrayed so much better. But instead, the film teeters on the edge of a radical feminist position.I've seen a lot of people say the film hates men. I disagree with this. I don't think it hates men. Instead, it takes a very simplistic, black and white view of Western culture and assumes that women's lives are overall difficult and men's lives are overall quite easy. When in reality, life is tough. For everyone. At least 99% of us. Claiming otherwise is unjust.However, it's not just the political stance it takes that brings the film down. It's how incessant it is. They are without any shame pushing a political message through the screen down your throat every 10 minutes. It's unbearable at times. Going to the cinema or watching a film should be an enjoyable experience, not a lecture.This film could've been beloved by all genders and ages. Both men and women love Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. This feels like an easy lay up for the filmmakers but by going the political route they end up having many jokes go over kids heads and alienate many of the people who where genuinely excited to see this film.I give it a 6 because of Gosling and most of the humour. It was enjoyable overall. I think Hollywood needs to stop employing multi millionaire actors to lecture the general public on how to live. It's embarrassing.236 out of 339 found this helpful.

"It pains me to say it, but I enjoyed this movie so much more then I was expecting to, musical numbers, humour, there truly is something for the whole family yo enjoy.Bright, garish and somewhat kitsch, those were my expectations, and sure it's a veritable cornucopia of glitter and rainbows, but what I wasn't expecting, was for the film to be so engaging, there's actually some real depth that I wasn't expecting. That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this. Greta Gerwig did a great job.Margot Robbie is glorious as Barbie, Ryan Gosling was great I thought. The pair shared some terrific scenes, real chemistry, and plenty of cutting one liners.Great use of music, everything fitted into the film so well.8.140 out of 324 found this helpful.

"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect. Overall, Barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy (sorry LEGO Movies) and an overall fantastic time at the movies.364 out of 768 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I got free tickets for a preview and to be honest I was more than a little embarrassed to go. I did not tell a soul. As a cool middle aged gentleman if word got out this could have really affected my street cred.Anyway, I embraced the journey and I'm glad that I did. Here is my review written as a pretentious critic that I aspire to be in my next life:In Greta Gerwig's latest directorial venture, ""Barbie,"" the esteemed filmmaker takes on the monumental task of unravelling the enigma that is Barbie, the iconic doll that has fascinated and polarized society for decades.With Margot Robbie as the eponymous character and Ryan Gosling as Ken, Gerwig's live-action rendition delves into the complex world of Barbie, attempting to extract deeper meaning from this cultural phenomenon.Gerwig masterfully navigates the treacherous waters of branded material, infusing the narrative with a blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. The result is a thought-provoking exploration of Barbie's role as a feminist symbol, challenging societal perceptions of femininity and girlhood.Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals?Gerwig compels the audience to contemplate this question, weaving it throughout the fabric of the film.In reality Margot Robbie dominated the film as expected and has developed into a true cinematic icon. The flm was fun and far above my expectations hence I'm giving it an 8 and boasting I watched Barbie.472 out of 1,096 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8,Barbie
"The film's universe and settings are fantastic. The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie. Instead, we're left with a film that almost divides and pits men against women, in an attempt to make it a feminist and political film.Instead of seeing a light, fun film, I saw a rather heavy-handed movie whose storyline is centered around patriarchy.It's a real shame, because the film's potential is pretty amazing. I came away disappointed, but not totally disgusted either.455 out of 729 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6,Barbie
"This is very much a movie that will get devided opinions on it, my cousin said well this is two hours of my life i will never get back, and me? I left the theatre in such a good mood. It was the sense of humor for me, laughed so hard. Specially Ryan Gossling was sooooo good and funny, many familiar faces to spot also. And margot robbie come on... the perfect casting for Barbie. I also have to say, the way they created Barbie land was so amazing, it just makes you just want to there. I don't really have anything bad to say about this movie. I can understand not everyone will love it. But i am sure it is a iconic film already.274 out of 611 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8,Barbie
"This movie is so much fun. It starts off really strong although the story does move away from ""Barbieland"" sooner than I would have liked. Nonetheless, it regains its footing with the final act in particular and I could not stop laughing at Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken. That song will forever be stuck in my head.There are also plenty of good messages to be taken away from this experience, that is if you're not an insecure middle-aged male terrified of women. I loved everything the movie had to say about the patriarchy and barbies and growing up and consumerism and so much more.I am excited to watch it again soon. The pacing is not perfect and its huge potential is not fully matched, but purely as a cinematic experience I will never forget this movie.164 out of 451 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss. The middle expositional phase of the movie, I must say, is a bore.The movie was so close to being great, but it was incapable of delivering a message without having a character literally give a speech worth of dialogue.What could have been a great satire and what began as a cleverly funny movie turned into a preachy and moralizing movie in the end. But I guess the charm of the first half of the movie made up for the shortcomings.47 out of 75 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6,Barbie
"Barbie is everything expected of it and so much more, a self aware and meta comedy made for fans and newcomers alike that's also incredibly profound, layered and really funny. It's the best version of itself and just immensely satisfying that the Barbie movie that got made on this scale is so weird and unique.Margot Robbie is perfect casting as Barbie, she nails the movement and switches between the eccentric Barbie Land and more emotionally tolling real world effortlessly. She has a terrific arc that's full of emotionally resonant moments and the almost parental nature with Gosling works beautifully.Ryan Gosling is phenomenal as Ken. Note perfect casting that gives him another welcome chance to move away from his usual introverted roles and tap into his impeccable comedic timing present in The Nice Guys, only here it's dialed up to eleven. It all culminates in a musical number that is painfully funny.Will Ferrell is essentially playing Lord Business again and him and his whole team of execs are just as cartoonish as the people in Barbie Land but it actually really works as a nice bit of satire that emphasises just how out of touch all of them are.America Ferrara gets one of the biggest speeches of the film and really makes it work and her relationship with Ariana Greenblatt adds a lot of heart to the film whilst allowing it to have its both ways when it comes to acknowledging the history of Barbie.Greta Gerwig's direction is excellent, getting the bigger budget she absolutely deserves and uses every penny. Magnificent dance numbers, a fun car chase and a Barbie Land that is as vibrant as possible and despite fully embracing its own artificial nature it feels more real and visually stunning than so much of what's out there.The soundtrack is another standout element, a great selection of songs from some of the best artists currently working all at the top of their game. Like the film, some are just really fun, some are very profound and every single one fits in effortlessly.131 out of 415 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I'm just going to get straight to the point: I liked some aspects of this movie and disliked other parts. Cinematography: awesome. Choreographed musical numbers: hilarious. Comedy: good. Margot Robbie: great. Ryan Gosling: awesome, and arguably the best part of the movie. The scenery and props really did help create the world. The storyline started off very intriguing. However, when the movie got to the meat of the plot and the central conflict, its message became confusing. It's like they wanted to make Ken the bad guy yet also sympathetic, which is not impossible or unheard of, but the way the writers did this was ineffective. Also, the resolution didn't make sense based on the message and events that led up to it. Lastly, I really hate it when movies try to empower women by dumbing down the men. I get that in a Barbie world, Ken is an afterthought, but in the real world all men were also dumb. They also treated masculine qualities as ""evil."" I hate stereotyping people, men included, and it's like all men ride horses and have fragile egos and drink ""brewskies."" And for goodness sake, if I had a dollar for every time the movie said ""patriarchy"", I'd be rich. So, overall, I give this movie a 6.1,007 out of 1,363 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"So I went into the movie with little to no expectations and I was pleasantly impressed with the movie overall.So basically the movie is about Barbie who is starting to feel emotions and not everything feels perfect in Barbieland. She ventures to the real world to discover the solution of getting everything perfect again. Barbie is joined by the one and not only KEN, Ken is obsessed with Barbie and sees her as the centre of his world, he goes to the real world and discovers patriarchy, which leads to many events.The movie overall is actually quite funny, Ryan Gosling is fantastic as Ken and the stand out for me, he needs to be many versions of Ken and he kills then all !! Margott is also great, she brings a range to Barbie, for me also Weird Barbie was great, she was funny and brought a difference.There were times I felt the ""woman power"" thing was just a bit much and took me out of the movie, I feel like the movie had that message and didn't need to shove it down your throat but it decided to at points so for me that does bring it down a notch, the daughter was also just annoying hahaha yes I get it she hated the world bla bla, she just had no redeeming qualities, otherwise no complains and I do think it's worth seeing, solid 8.53 out of 139 found this helpful.

"I mean, Margo Robbie as Barbie just made perfect sense, but I really wanted to see the movie when I herd that Ryian Gosling was going to be Ken, I just thought that would be hilarious and I was right!I was a little bit nervous when I heard this was not going to be an in-universe thing and that Barbie would enter the real world, but that was a great story.The real-life story did give the art direction the purpose of making a ""BarbieLand"" with life size dream houses even I wanted to live in. The film just looks really good.Give praise to director Greta Gerwig because this movie is fun but there were a lot of deep life cuts and the balance between the two was perfect.It was good hands down.19 out of 59 found this helpful.

"The movie was very funny and really enjoyable to laugh at with the full theatre. However, the messages of the movie were the problem. I was never really sure what I was supposed to take away, there was nothing about finding equality or love it was all about how every man cat falls every woman or women can't be anything. It was really silly because there was no accurate reflection of America at any single point except for Barbie getting called a Fascist for no reason by a 14 year old. I enjoyed how they called out women for hating women and how they really tried to preach empowerment and the ability to be anything, but at the same time there was so much resentment and they ended the movie by reinstating hate. The majority of the movie was hating men as much as possible. That's just whatever because what really matters is the story. Well it fell short on that mark and it was really disappointing. The pacing was horrible, the villain won and was pretty irrelevant in the long run, the story was all over the place, and it is totally not for kids. I think the worst part is how disappointed I was at the opportunity to really make something special and it just wasn't. 6 points for all the laughs and fun I had and I would expect 6-7 to be an appropriate rating.106 out of 178 found this helpful.

"Barbie is based on Mattel's iconic plastic dolls of the same name. Barbie(Margot Robbie) lives a very happy life in Barbie Land, along with her fellow Barbies, Ken(Ryan Gosling) & his fellow Kens. Suddenly, Barbie goes through an existential crisis that makes her question Barbie Land & the truth of her existence.Barbie is a phenomenal film. Director Greta Gerwig has given us a movie that is a tribute to everyone who used to play with Barbie dolls during their childhood, while also making fun of all the tropes of Barbie dolls & Ken dolls. This film is hilarious, with a few emotional scenes that will make you tear up & a beautiful message at the end. The production design by Sarah Greenwood is awe-inspiring. All the songs are foot-tappingly flawless. The choreography is faultless. Margot Robbie is outstanding as Barbie. Robbie's multi-layered portrayal of the titular character, proves that she's the perfect choice to play Barbie. Ryan Gosling is spectacular as Ken. Gosling portrays a wide range of emotions, effortlessly. Ryan Gosling's Ken is the highlight of the movie. America Ferrera is fantastic as Gloria. Ariana Greenblatt is awesome as Sasha. Will Ferrell is hysterical as the Mattel CEO. Michael Cera is perfect as Allan. Helen Mirren is epic as the Narrator. The supporting cast is superb. Barbie is a must watch for a burst of childhood nostalgia & fans of Greta Gerwig, Margot Robbie & Ryan Gosling. Wear a bright pink shirt, grab your friends, head to your nearest theatre, watch it on the big screen & have an absolute whale of a time!30 out of 99 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?40 out of 62 found this helpful.

"The concept of a Barbie movie is really unique and got me all exited. But unfortunately to me it delivers the same messages that we keep hearing as of lately.It started off quite funny, but after 45 minutes or so, the movie went in a direction I did not like. It took itself a bit too serious. I would have preferred a more lighthearted movie.Ryan Gosling did the best job out of everyone playing Ken I thought. The perfect guy with the perfect body and yet very campy, girly and insecure. Job well done, especially toward the end.If you are a fan of Barbie, you will probably get your money's worth.101 out of 178 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I cried, I laughed, I dance and I did sing too. What a joyful time I had at the movies watching Barbie. This is a movie to celebrate how diverse and complicated are the humans. The cinematography is a outstanding as well as the production design and the vestuary. The casting seems like made in heaven. I recommend this movie for 11+ years old. And if you have a teen at home, take her with you. Barbie goes from fun to introspection and I love a good comedy that makes you think. Ryan Gosling is the perfect Ken, he does everything in this movie and shines every time he shows up. Margo is a perfect Barbie and got a real sense of the relevance this is going to have.268 out of 766 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Without consumerism, without belief, without plastic accessory and hope for a perfect day, where would Barbie find herself?And more importantly where would we find ourselves?In a plot that seems stitched together like an old pair of vintage jeans (that you just can't let go of), Greta Gerwig serves us a platter of modern satire and deep analysis of the condition that we find ourselves in today.Barbie is perfect. Until she's not. And she's becomes accustomed to our culture. The perspective of an otherwise perfect doll born from a matriarchy is wholly interesting and captivating as we laugh, hate and cry throughout the movie. Barbie must find out what is wrong with her owner but in doing so she discovers imperfect humanity and falls in love with it. This is the story and it is told brilliantly.There is no need to mention the phenomenal performances by each and every actor in this film. The set design, the costumes, the cinematography are all a testament to Greta Gerwigs skill as a director.To view this film as merely a feminist blockbuster is to ignore the fact that feminism is not just woman's problem but a humanity's problem. This is what the movie displays. Go into it with an open mind and you will see that it does not preach for women to rule men but for men and women to discover themselves without being pressured by the culture around them. A message which needs to be broadcast across the world in a time of such needless division.We are all forced to live like dolls in this world and we must escape from this and discover ourselves. It is amazing to see Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach tackle such daring themes and pull it off. The comedy throughout provided by celebrity cameos and hilarious satire is spot on.The soundtrack is astounding and in particular Billie Eilish's song ""What was I made for?"" is a fantastic close to the journey of discovery that Barbie and Ken have been through.A brilliant achievement in modern film making that makes me hopeful for the future as we tackle more and more complex issues head on - rather than watch boring old men debate uselessness on YouTube.3 out of 4 found this helpful.

"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.236 out of 390 found this helpful.

"What a film! I was ecstatic about seeing Barbie and it definitely exceeded my expectations by far. As much as I was excited, I was a bit scared that the stakes were too high; after all Barbie is an icon and a part of so many people's childhood. For a film like this it's very easy to create something corny, disappointing, or unappealing to viewers. I'm so glad that Gretta Gerwig stepped up to the plate and created an absolute masterpiece.The film starts with showing the origin of Barbie in 1959. It explains how little girls used to play with baby dolls and commonly acted as their mothers, but wanted a doll that they could really play with instead of taking care of. And that's how Barbie came about. Then we see the beautiful Barbie world where every Barbie is a part of something. We see Barbie doctors, Barbie novelists, Barbie astronauts, Barbie everything! And in Barbie's world every day is perfect. The star of the show Margot Robbie plays ""Stereotypical Barbie"" and she starts to notice strange things happening to her. She has to visit the real world to see who was playing with her to discover why these strange things are happening. The rest of the film is about Barbie trying to find herself and discovering scary aspects of the real world that she was blinded by before.There was so much love put into this film and you can really see that on screen. The comedy in this film is so on point that the whole theater was laughing when I went to see this film. Huge kudos to Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, writers of this incredible screenplay. The script is pure genius; I love how the film really honors Barbie and what she was made for. The cast of this film is exceptional. Margot Robbie was originally producing the film until she was cast as Barbie. Margot is the perfect Barbie; she plays this role so well she is like a real-life Barbie on screen. The way she embodies Barbie is just so perfect. I was really excited to see Ryan Gosling as Ken since he's one of my favorite actors. There's a lot of controversy as to why Ryan Gosling was cast as Ken but he makes perfect sense. He plays Ken so well he really nails what it means to be Ken in this film. America Ferrera plays a Mom named Gloria and she is such an interesting character. She plays a mom who's going through struggles of just being a woman and I'm sure her character will speak to so many mothers. It would be a crime to not talk about the insane set. Funny enough, Greta Gerwig used so much pink paint for this set that it actually drained an entire company's supply. The Barbie world is exactly as you'd expect it -- from Barbie dream-houses to Barbie beaches -- everything looks like it came right out of a toy store. Rodrigo Prieto shot this film and the cinematography is extraordinary. As someone who grew up with Barbie, this film really speaks to me. I am in love with the score of this film. Billie Eilish's ""What was I made for"" is one of the most beautiful songs I've heard. This film is packed with so many great artists like Tame Impalla, Lizzo, Dua Lipa and many others.The film is packed with so many messages. I was surprised with how many topics this film covers -- what it means to be a woman, what it means to be a mother, what it's like to grow up in today's society, what is love, and so much more. This film is a celebration of women and girlhood but I also love how it represents men. Ken is discovering how men are viewed in today's society in a similar way to how Barbie is discovering who she is.I give Barbie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults.

"Some friends freaking out that I went to see Barbie lol I mean I mentioned I went coz my sister insisted since ages. Anyway the movie was bad. These days, every other director and producer wants to convey messages about women rights and feminism through whatever platform possible and this movie was a perfect example of that with sheer cringe to convey all that. I wished I had gotten the ticket for Oppenheimer in the same timings as my sister's Barbie show. Other than that, the acting done by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling was great so can't take that away from them. They did justice to their roles.141 out of 243 found this helpful.

"Wow. WOW!!!!My favorite movie of all time is Aliens. It's been my favorite movie since I was 5-years-old. I'm 38 now. That has NEVER changed.Until THIS.And I bet you are thinking this review is satire. It's NOT.I'm BLOWN away. Barbie is now my favorite movie of all time - successfully unseating Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. I never thought I would see the day.The movie makes you think it's going to be just a fun, silly movie to mock. NO. It's not. It's brilliantly written. It's written so well that all the adult messaging goes right over the little kids heads but still gives them plenty of enjoyment.The movie sparked really great discussion with my daughter who is 8-years-old. We discussed why it's so important to value ourselves and what the patriarchy is. It's just... mind blowingly good.And also - a good reminder to all women. WE ARE ENOUGH. We are good enough. And we need to raise our daughters to be confident and leaders if that's the path they choose.64 out of 241 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"As a guy who never played with Barbie dolls, I was surprised to be caught up in the enthusiasm to see this movie; I purchased tickets well in advance when they first went on sale.It's amazing to think that, a few years back, Amy Schumer was going to star in the title role. Though after seeing Margot Robbie, it's hard to imagine anyone else in that spot.Anyway ... like most moviegoers - I enjoyed this movie. It's a lot like The Lego Movie with its high energy, colorful world-building, meta jokes, self-aware characters and variety of insider (fan) humor. The ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" beginning, (clearly aimed at adult viewers) was priceless.However unlike The Lego Movie I can definitely say that the first half was enormously more entertaining compared to the second. The first half was energized by all the Barbie accessories, character introductions, high-energy music and a very cool plot reveal involving the ""real world"".But unlike The Lego Movie, the second half (while not bad) wasn't able to keep the momentum going. While there was a lot of action and drama ... it felt more hit-and-miss.The message was good: you don't have to be perfect to be happy ... just be true to yourself. However, its delivery felt a bit too complex for kids - and maybe even for some adults.The empowering commentary about womanhood was eloquent ... but it seemed like the writers had trouble getting from that point to a strong and uplifting ending. It almost felt a bit melancholy for whatever reason.But - don';t let that stop you from enjoying this movie! There's a lot to like and it's kind of a cultural moment and opportunity to connect with all the Barbie-love that spans generations. Enjoy this experience with a big audience and you'll be glad you did.7 out of 10 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7,Barbie
"It's really something different but some of it feels inspired by other films, I caught references to Fight Club, 2001 Space Odyssey, Lego Movie, and others I can't think of at the moment. But yeah, this was a special film. I don't think as many people will like it as it probably deserves. But I did love most of it. Sometimes the tones felt off at times but it's definitely recommended to see. The satire works great here and the production design, cinematography and acting (intentionally bad in a way on purpose in some spots to deliver the satire aspects) are all perfectly done here though overall. The music is a highlight here too which is sometimes hilarious and reminded me of the Lego movie in some ways. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are both pitch perfect here as well. Definitely recommend anyone to give it a chance. I wouldn't say this is a family movie but I think families with older kids would work perfectly for this. Not sure this will be in the Oscar race but it seems like it will at least for technical aspects and production designs.66 out of 262 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I appreciated it but wasn't a huge fan of Greta Gerwig's first two films. I knew absolutely nothing about Barbie except that it was a doll. The trailers didn't impress me. I slept less than an hour last night. I watched the movie alone surrounded by teenagers who cheered when the WB logo appeared in pink.The conditions were set for this to go wrong, but Gerwig's vision for Barbie won me over. The film starts in the perfect, goofy, and funny Barbie Land, but it doesn't take long to move to the real world. Curiously, while most of the action in the real world works well, it's also where I felt some issues, mainly with the Mattel executives' characters. Let's say it was the only time I felt that the silliness of the film (and it's indeed very silly) went too far. The third act wraps everything up perfectly, with some fantastic speeches and a strong conclusion. Margot Robbie is great in the role of Barbie, but there's a big surprise in America Ferrera, and Ryan Gosling steals all the attention whenever he's on screen. All the supporting cast is hilarious.Younger audiences will love the colours, the incredible production design, and the light tone. However, this is a very adult film in the themes it addresses, managing to be highly relevant without ever ceasing to entertain. The feminist traits are well-defined, and it's an homage to women, but not only that. It's primarily about self-discovery, finding our own path, and being true to ourselves.44 out of 204 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8,Barbie
"Weeks ago I heard that there was going to be a Barbie movie coming out and my immediate first thought was ""Oh, God."" I then forgot about it and then saw the trailer for it when we went to see the new Indiana Jones movie. I always enjoy seeing Margot Robbie when I can and Ryan Gosling looked like he was going to bring some humor to the movie, so when my wife asked if I wanted to see it, I said SURE! I'm glad I did.The movie was as amusing as I hoped, and it didn't overly rely on tired story lines to make it entertaining. What it also had was a lot of heart. Margot Robbie is an actress that has a ton of sex appeal, but she doesn't use it. She uses her great skill as an actress to convey the story and does it very well.What was really fun about this movie was listening to the kids in the theater responding to it and it was pretty hilarious. My daughter and I were laughing more at that than anything. It was actually a delightful surprise that added to the whole vibe of the movie.Ryan Gosling played a goofball Ken, but he does so in a very controlled and amusing way, and you actually feel for Ken bigtime as the story moves along. He did a great job as well as the rest of the cast that made up all the Barbies and Kens.The only thing I will say takes away from this movie is Will Ferrell. I normally find him amusing in most movies he is in, but in this one, he was completely superfluous. He added not a single laugh nor important aspect to the story line. He just was not needed in this movie.So, if you have a daughter of any age, go see it with her and laugh. It's truly a good time.32 out of 131 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Even though I'm not the target audience for this movie, I thought Barbie might impress me due to Greta Gerwig's previous works but I'm disappointed.The main problem is that the overall message isn't clear. This doesn't go to say that the movie is frivolous. What happens is that it gets lost trying to get around multiple meaningful topics and never reaches the punchline. It addresses relevant themes like patriarchy, sexism, gender roles, existencialism, imperfection, individuality and identity but always on a shallow level. Every scene in this script tries to convince you that it's saying something profound when in reality it sacrifices depth and character development in favor of cheap humor, which results in an immature and non-compelling production.In contrast, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were perfectly casted and their performances are as good as the screenplay allows them to be. The production and costume design from Barbie Land are noteworthy too.Hopefully Greta Gerwig will release other movies in the future as brilliant as Lady Bird, which I genuinely think deserves 5 stars.16 out of 24 found this helpful.

"Finally got around to viewing this, and it was really great fun. A solid story. It's Aldus Huxley's 'Brave New World' and Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis', done with lots of pink and lots of music and dancing, far more than I expected.Margo Robbie pretty much owns this movie, and rightly so. She and Ryan Gosling take over the screen and must of had a load of fun.The set design is very inventive and is very pivotal to the films plot. Never seen so many high heels in a mainstream movie. So many great costumes that help along with the pop background.Really silly and funny look at life, very metaphoric, plenty of fun here, the screening was full, just 6 seats left.1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"The brilliant marketing is what led us tonight to pay for the tickets. The brilliance ends there.Performance of the lead actors is very good - as good as you may expect given the very poor story and weak directing. And that's it. The humour is forced. The satire is replaced by lectures conveyed by characters. All the ""bad"" characters are absolutely flat, lacking any depth. Even dancing is very poorly choreographed. Whatever you may expect from the trailers is missing in the movie.The photography is good though. So the average is 5 It is another plainly bad movie that is trying to hide behind agenda.123 out of 166 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",5,Barbie
"When I sat down to watch this film I assumed it would be some fun pink silly movie but it was not in the best possible way. It starts very much in that way but the second Barbie gets to the real world everything changes and the film makes so many important statements on sexism and the treatment of women. I thought it perfectly addressed the affect Barbie has had on the world and never shied away from it. This movie does not flinch away from the reality of the world or what damage ignorance can do (Ken). America Ferrera's speech is amazing and moved me so much as did Barbie's own found freedom. Robbie was an amazing Barbie and all the women shined in this movie...and Alan was pretty good too. It was everything you can want from a movie, sharp, whitty, moving, honest and progressive. The perfect Barbie.62 out of 236 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Okay maybe it was a 9.5 because of two flaws: First was the Will Ferrell character and his board that made their point but then became superfluos. Second was that it is definitely not a kids' movie (although maybe they would see things that I didn't - I mean to be fair, the few kids in the theatre were well behaved so perhaps the movie got their full attention as well).But why did I enjoy it? Simply amazing visuals, Margot Robbie looked flawlessly gorgeous and played it perfectly. Ryan Gosling was also brilliant in this. Great music, great pacing and then there was the script. There were a lot of messages in this film that trod a tightrope between pithy, ironic, sarcastic and cliched. But I reckon they just about managed it which, considering the subject matter, was quite an accomplishment. I will need to see it a second time to check whether the messages were balanced and as meaningful as they were meant to be but I hope that women were as upbeat about it as i was. Overall, on an enjoyment level alone, it deserves its high score from me.21 out of 66 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"I think part of my brain rejects this for being a feature-length toy commercial, but it's a very small part of my brain (and that really wasn't where my mind was for the majority of the movie).Overall, it's probably about as good as an official live-action Barbie movie could ever be, with Greta Gerwig clearly given plenty of freedom to have fun with a property/movie like this. It's bigger in scale than her previous two films (Ladybird and Little Women, both of which I prefer to this by a little), and the scale and creativity of the film really kept the momentum going. It's very funny in parts, and though I guess it's sort of a kid-friendly movie, there are tons of jokes and references that'll go over the heads of younger kids. ""What's a fascist?"" is something I heard a four-year-old ask one of their parents halfway through the movie, and that in itself was kind of funny to hear.Margot Robbie is good as always, and is given a surprising amount to do emotionally. It is Barbie's movie, but Ryan Gosling's Ken often steals the film whenever he's on-screen (as the film's wrapping up, there's a fairly awkward pivot to ""oh yeah, this is Barbie's movie;"" it's even addressed in dialogue). I don't think that's a problem, because he's hilarious - it might be one of the best performances he's ever given. I also don't think his character is used ""just"" to attack men, the way I imagine some people will read into it. Barbie does the most learning and has the biggest character arc, sure, but Ken goes through one too, and I thought they wrapped up that side of things nicely.It's an enjoyable movie that deals with some hefty topics (namedropping plenty of words younger kids won't have even heard before) in a mostly consistent way. Some tonal shifts are jarring, and while the vast majority of jokes land, I don't think all did. It does also feel a bit too directly like a commercial at a couple of points, especially early on, but I did expect that. And it's a testament to the quality of the movie that me and all my anti-consumerist thoughts didn't overpower my mind throughout most of this.10 out of 36 found this helpful.

"I really enjoyed the movie. The acting was amazing. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling was amazing. I just thought it was too on the nose. Like the message was literally forced in your face. It seemed lazy to me. I went in thinking it was going to be similar to The Truman Show and I wished it had've taken some elements from it because it would've made it much more powerful if so. I'm not going to spoil the ending but I thought the writers just gave up. Overall for me it's a 6. Good film but that's all. Definitely could've been less preachy. Ultimately, it's nice movie to see and I'd see it again at some point but it wasn't great.34 out of 49 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6,Barbie
"Addresses current critical issues; basically, the movie revolves around that. The central ideas are patriarchy and female empowerment, which I believe were handled intelligently and elegantly. I was particularly surprised in this regard; I didn't expect the film to be so mature.I also want to highlight the makeup, set, photography and choreography. Top-notch, flawless.The context is also interesting; the script is creative, and the story is engaging, making the film much more fluid. Personally that's what I liked the most, how the fantasy and the reality interact. The actors were amazing too, and not only the main characters.Some other human characters were underdeveloped compared to Barbie and Ken, but that was expected.As a man I recon that this is a movie that speaks to women, but also to men sensible to women struggles. I went to watch it without expecting more than a visually beautiful film, and I left the cinema positively surprised.122 out of 392 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I suspect this is a personal thing. Who you are defines what you may get from this.Me - I'm well into my mid life (had my crisis already thank you). I have daughters and both have watched this. I'm also pretty laid back to life. I encourage my children to be whatever the heck they wanna be and help them as much as I can.Now to the movie.For an afternoon showing, it was 2/3 full and mostly women and girls. Just an observation. But it was.The film is fun. It's tootles along with lots of off beat moments, a great monologue near the end (got teary there), silliness and self awareness (lots of self referential humour).My girls enjoyed it. I did too but not sure it's like 9 good. It's definitely enjoyable but 7 good.A Barbie movie could have been really bad. Really it could have been. But as has been shown by Lego movie, Detective Pickachu and few others....you can take something predominantly aimed at children and make it into something that both adults and children can engage with.The core message is great.I must say, I have heard a lot about Ryan Gosling being funny. He's ok. At least to me, he wasn't laugh out loud funny. There are much funnier things in this.But it is funny and enjoyable enough.Will Barbie dramatically change the landscape for dialogue? No, I don't think it will. It will though give pause for thought to all those who do go view it.A good, fun movie worth paying for the entertainment.2 out of 2 found this helpful.

"I was be able to attend the pre premiere of this movie and I have to say this movie was unexpectetly good and this comes from a non Barbie fan. Barbie is the role Robbie was clearly born to play. Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu were incredible too and actually the whole cast of this movie shines ! Barbie is a brilliantly executed, incredibly fun, brightly colored, completely logical feminist statement that should be remembered come awards season. Ultimately, Barbie is so many things: a stereotype, a toy, an idea; a vessel of imagination; a cultural relic. But in Gerwig's trusted hands, this is Barbie like you've never seen her before.100 out of 350 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8,Barbie
"I wanted to like it. But I just didn't. The story wasn't very compelling to me because it seemed as if the entire point of much of the movie was to provide learning moments for viewers with some slapstick comedy and quick-delivery comedy. The story itself should nearly always be more important.All of the goofiness largely would have been excused to me if the comedic moments were really funny. And the way this film was hyped made me think it was going to be super funny. But I rarely laughed. And that's even more of a shame given the talent assembled for the cast. There also weren't many surprising reveals to the audience when maybe there could have been if things were presented differently.I also found it annoying to see Will Farrell play a similar part to what he played in the Lego Movie. Sure he's a CEO rather than a dad. But he was filling the same evil disciplinarian adult role for a movie about a kid's toy. It just felt lazy to not cast someone else for that part, and just made me wish the movie was able to provide the humor and intrigue that the first Lego movie provided to its audience.I'd rather this film felt like a comedy or dramatic experience which has some relevant takes on feminism and culture than thinly veiled sermon with occasional jokes that land amongst a ton that didn't land.I also felt like the movie had way too many characters and ideas thrown together. There was Barbie, Ken, many other Barbies, many other Kens, the crazy Barbie, the CEOs, the mother, the teen, the narrator and more. And it's not just that they had all of these characters. They also tried to have some learning moments delivered-by or delivered-to a majority of these characters. I felt like they would have been better off trying to deliver all these lessons over 3-5 movies rather than 1. And obviously you don't want it ever to seem like the lessons are being delivered but experiences through the story and the consequences of the actions and stakes created by the characters' decisions. Instead there didn't seem like any stakes because the Barbies didn't seem to fit in the real world and the real people didn't fit in the Barbie world.Honestly my favorite part of the movie was a lot of the Easter egg stuff about odd Barbie products over the years. And Easter eggs shouldn't be the best part of any movie. They should be a bonus to the overall experience of the story.45 out of 62 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"The Margot Robbie/Ryan Gosling curiosity BARBIE is a subversive film. This Greta Gerwig directed move lures you in by presenting a farcical/satirical look at the pastel colored ""Barbieland"" and the myriad of outfits and ""golly-gosh"" goodness of the world of this iconic Mattel doll (and her boyfriend, Ken). Once you are comfortably settled into this world, you are transformed to the ""real world"" and the much deeper themes of a women's place in a patriarchal world.As another toy's slogan puts it, ""there's more than meets the eye"" to this film.And one should have expected something more than just a ""surfacey-fun"" film from the Writer/Director of such fare as LADYBIRD and FRANCES HA. Gerwing uses the stereotypes of Barbie and Ken to take a look at our society and the inherent hierarchy of the sexes while peeling back the layers of the key players to make them more than the plastic dolls they portray.And...it works surprisingly well for adults - not so much for kids.Margot Robbie, of course, is perfectly cast as the titular Barbie. She has the looks and the vacuous devil-may-care attitude of ""Stereotype Barbie"" and is a comfortable, pleasing entity to share this adventure with. But, with Gerwig's direction, Robbie's performance reveals, subtly, layer after layer until - at the end - we end up with a full fledged character and not just a living doll.Ryan Gosling is just as strong as Barbie's counterpart, Ken. He morphs from a Barbie worshipping boyfriend to something else once he encounters the real, male-dominated world. The BankofMarquis wondered why Gosling would agree to do a film that, on it's surface, appears to be a one-note joke-fest, but once the film really drives to it's point, one can see why Gosling agreed to be in this.Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Simu Liu, Michael Cerra, Helen Mirren (as the narrator) and America Ferrara all spark - at times - during this film while it was good to see Rhea Perlman (Carla on CHEERS) have a role that she could sink her teeth into.Only Will Ferrell - as the money hungry CEO of Mattel - falls short of interesting. His character - one of the only ""real world"" characters in this film - stays stereotypical throughout the movie. He is the only complete caricature in this film...and perhaps that is on purpose.Credit for the surprising depth of this film goes to Gerwig who brings her sensibilities to this film to make a comment on our society. It's a bold move by Gerwig and works well...unless you are a Mom that is bringing your 5 or 6 year old child to this film.And, that is the caution to this movie. It's not, necessarily, made for the youngsters that play with Barbies. The kids will love the early going of this film, but the more adult themes in the middle of the movie will probably make a good deal of them squirm in their seats, since these moments of depth will go over their heads.A surprisingly fun...and deeper than it appears to be....film, this Barbie is a multi-level dreamhouse.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the BankofMarquis.30 out of 136 found this helpful.

"Barbie is a really fun movie that all ages can enjoy because while it's colourful and entertaining the main storyline can get emotional at times. The comedy in the movie is pretty funny too and got a few laughs from everyone in the cinema, the music is really nice and so are the choreographed dances. What I liked the most about this movie is that it was very doll-like, the food and drink were plastic and fake, the cars didn't have engines and just glided along the floor, and the actors were doll-like in their movements and how they interacted with their environment.The sheer amount of details that are in this movie is amazing, from the clothes, the wide variety of dolls, cars, pets, houses, and even down to the accessories were a perfect match to what's being sold or what has been sold in the past. On another note, I was not expecting the plot twist and the antagonist to be revealed, but that's what I liked about this movie, I went in thinking to know what this movie was going to be about but I was wrong and was surprised. As the movie progresses you find yourself enjoying it more and more, it's well paced and it has a good story so I definitely recommend it!31 out of 128 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I'm a man in his 40's and I know I'm clearly not their target demographic. I went with my girlfriend and her two daughters and they enjoyed it.The sets were all very very well done. They put a lot of time into them. The acting was awful, but awful on purpose? I'm not sure. The plot was confusing at times. I wasn't sure what that big battle was for. Why were they fighting? No reason or lead up to it was there.I really enjoyed the scenes when they were in the real world. They did good with the 'fish out of water' thing. I laughed a couple times.The sexual innuendos were there and I thought they were funny but thankfully my girlfriends daughters did not understand them.I would say a 11-13 year old girl would enjoy this.4 out of 6 found this helpful.

"But it is also in its smallest details, from the art direction, costumes, and any technical choice completely thought of referencing all Barbie generations and the like. A soundtrack that will take you from laughing to crying (yes, very musical moments, after all it is a Barbie movie), in addition to the hand-picked cast, Margot is impeccable and manages to express all her feelings, just with her eyes. Greta's direction and screenplay, just amazing, strong, emotional, empowering and very, very feminist, not only for the women who are already fighting for the cause, but to open everyone's eyes to a sisterhood.13 out of 49 found this helpful.

"I am a man but watched this movie it's awesome Margot Robbie very beautiful but i like the performance of Ryan Gosling a lot this movie It's full of imagination and it surprises me a lot.Especially if anyone is a Barbie fan, let me tell you, this event is very satisfying.Even I'm not looking fun. And in the movie part, it's bad comedy and teasing yourself (Warner) quite a bit .. You have to go and see for yourself and you will definitely laugh.Ryan Gosling's acting is so good, I'm sure there's a lot of laughs out there during filming.This is another very good performance for this man.What the movie does is like imagination that doesn't have to care about logic. Let's just say the story is like we're playing with dolls and assuming the role of that character...126 out of 367 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9,Barbie
"Before making Barbie (2023), Greta Gerwig single-handedly directed two films: Lady Bird (2017) and Little Women (2019). Both were about girls on the precipice of adolescence, both had nuanced and layered portrayals of mother-daughter relationships, both combined imaginative visuals with clever dialogue. Both were very, very good. Given those credentials, one may expect Barbie to be as intelligent, convincing and amusing a picture - and, well, it isn't.The fantasy comedy begins in Barbie Land, a place where Barbie (played by Margot Robbie) is having the best day every day, in the company of other Barbies and, occasionally, Kens. The designs, costumes, and cinematography do an excellent job re-creating the Mattel vision in its pink plastic perfection. The introduction is referential but not overtly reliant on what is external to the film; it is smartly self-aware and presents a world where Barbie can be anything - a President, a Physicist, a Journalist, a Lawyer, or a Mermaid. Much like with the original toys, Ken () comes as an afterthought and 'only exists within the warmth of Barbie's gaze'.The plot is set in motion when Barbie begins having thoughts about death and, normally suspended in the state of standing on the balls of her feet, she feels her heels hit the ground. What follows is journey in reverse (the parallel is explicit) and, ultimately, a Pinocchio storyline of the doll in the Real World.If Barbie was fully dedicated to that conceit - as promised by the trailer - it could be an interesting exploration in the way of or . Instead, the film chooses to introduce a handful of conflicts, threats, and plot-lines that are never fully realised. What is the nature of the connection between a Barbie and the girl who plays with the doll in the Real World? What would happen if Barbie were put back in the box? Why is Gloria (), the receptionist at the Mattel headquarters and, later, Barbie's Real-World companion, depressed - and how is that eventually resolved? Why is Gloria's daughter Sasha () cross with her mother? Why does the board of Mattel spend one third of the film hiding in the bushes? Most importantly, the crux of the third-act conflict - set in Barbie Land now renamed 'Kendom' - contradicts what had been previously established about that world and its inhabitants.Towards the finale, the production evolves into explicit commentary on gender roles. One side is presented as clueless and attention-seeking, while the other is manipulative and vengeful. The film repeatedly takes offence with 'mansplaining', yet behaves in a blithely patronising manner towards the viewer. Much of what is declared is not supported by what has been shown, and the picture relies on the presumed prior experience of the audience, rather than on storytelling. While the denouement includes one of the film's highlights, the musical number 'I'm Just Ken', the ending does not resolve (or acknowledge) much, and the final scene is reductive to the point of being offensive.Barbie is very easy on the eye, and the acting ranges from competent to inspired, with praiseworthy performances by the leading actors. Margot Robbie is pitch-perfect as Barbie, and Ryan Gosling shines as her counterpart, often stealing the show. Situational comedy and slapstick mostly land, while some of the bon mots are funny, yet hardly plausible when spoken by the characters.If only this were better written. If only the joyride in the pink convertible did not leave you with blond hair in your mouth.10 out of 19 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6,Barbie
"I have been waiting for this to release for so long and I finally got to watch it today. I absolutely loved it! It was fun, it had Margot Robbie (and extra stuff for Tarantino's out there if you know what I mean) And it had some absolute bangers! What more could you want from a new summer classic?Honestly the depth of the story ain't there but what do you expect from a film about a Barbie? Lol I'll probably go back and watch it again tbh and I'll probably purchase it once it releases on blu ray as I did rather enjoy it (seriously my mouth hurts from smiling and laughing) there are some touching moments where Robbie really shines I just wish there were a little more because as everyone I absolutely adore Margot and her films.Anyway Barbie is a blast. It's a definite recommend on my list.3 out of 6 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9,Barbie
"Barbie vs Oppenheimer, was an amazing event to take place, if you want to say they were even going against each other, it was very enjoyable to see this take place though.But as for Barbie the movie was okay in my opinion, it was no doubt hilarious and joyful, I would probably rewatch it for that reason. But the movie itself just kind of lacked something, I think the story was okay, had some good messages. Some parts just didn't work well, the storyline of the daughter didn't make sense, because one scene she's mean and terrible then all of the sudden she's nice, just didn't work that well.But overall it was just okay, probably won't watch it again.4 out of 5 found this helpful.

"My wife and I did the double feature of Barbie and Oppenheimer. Barbie started off strong and Ryan Gosling is very funny in the movie. The problem is none of the Barbies are in a comedy. This movie should have been 90 minutes of comedy. It maybe could have had a simple heartfelt moment between a mom and her daughter but this movie has several preachy moments that made me wonder, who is this movie for?

"A fun and clever enough comedy and twist on the world's most famous doll with wonderful production values, a charming Margot Robbie and an absolute hilarious Ryan Gosling.Ultimately, Barbie is so many things: a stereotype, a toy, an idea; a vessel of imagination; a cultural relic. But in Gerwig's trusted hands, this is Barbie like you've never seen her before.Cinematography is great here, Set pieces are outstanding and the Soundtrack is a masterpiece.I want to take a minute to take about Greta Gerwig she is so clever and talented hope this movie will push her to direct big blockbuster movies that she deserves.87 out of 347 found this helpful.

"If you told me a few years ago that one of the best movies in 2023, and arguably the highest-grossing one is going to be Barbie, I would have laughed and called you crazy. But here we are, and the atmosphere in the theatre felt like a cultural revolution, which can become ""You just had to be there"" moment for the Gen-Zs.Through the medium of this film, Greta Gerwig expresses the frustrations of all women, and at the same time presents a satirical take on patriarchy. The movie praises Barbie for being a feminist icon, but at the same acknowledges it's regressiveness. Ken is basically every man who embodies patriarchal ideals just for being rejected, as he feels accepted in the real world but gets ignored in the Barbieland, which was a stark reflection on how women feel in the real world. At the end, it has a beautiful message for all women.The script is genuinely funny with bucket-load of hilarious moments and lines. Ryan Gosling brings his A-game as Ken, saying that his expressions are hilarious would be an understatement. Ryan has basically understood the assignment. Margot Robbie was basically born to play the role of Barbie, as she fits into the role to a T. You can feel her as she is going through an existential crisis.The set-design and costumes were praiseworthy and clearly deserves an Oscar nod. The costumes of each Barbies and Kens have been designed so beautifully and intricately, that it bears a mention. The buildings in Barbieland have also been created with love and passion for the universe. The architecture of the movie is a visual treat for the audience.The cinematography of the film does a good job of presenting the Barbie with glitz and glitter. It is pink and completely unapologetic about it.The soundtrack is an icing on the cake. 'I am just Ken' is still stuck on my mind, as I am penning down this review. However, I do feel that the supporting cast was wasted, as thsy had very little to do.In conclusion, the movie is a popcorn-muncher but at the same time delivers a heartfelt message which is very important for the world.15 out of 49 found this helpful.

"So i've just got back from theaters and all i got to say is wow, that was such a fun, funny, charming movie and the Barbie world was just so colorful ! ( which we knew from the trailers )Now before you say anything... no, this movie doesn't hate men, if anything it understands men's struggles just as much as women's, i was scared that the movie whould demonizes(?) Ken too much but he was really funny and you could see where he was coming from, with him always being in Barbie's shadows and all thatSpeaking of Barbie, Margot Robbie is the perfect Barbie, she was so perfect that now i have difficulties imagining anyone else as the role of a life action Barbie, and look, i'm not saying this is the best movie of the year but for now... it's the one i liked the most.18 out of 65 found this helpful.

"I saw this movie tonight and it was very entertaining but if your a parent and have young Children THEY WILL GET BORED as this is not a kids movie, it is on a higher intellectual plain than that. You could honestly say this is a movie for feminists, now thats not a bad thing as I saw it with my daughter and have always encouraged her to be whoever she wanted to be and played with Barbie when she was young (she's 23 now) .This movie has it's moments of comedy and is well done especially when in the Barbie world and has been well thought out and written. Cast very well as the two leads carry the movie and i'm sure there will be a sequel. But remember this is not a KIDS movie.3 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Fantastic movie! The writing and storyline is so much deeper than I could have imagined for a Barbie movie. I loved this movie so much that I saw it twice opening week and plan to buy it once it hits streaming. I think women and girls of all ages will love it. I know plenty of guys who like it as well. It's smart, funny, clever, deep, thoughtful, etc. I was actually in tears during the America Ferrera monolog. These actors are all amazing. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gossling were the perfect Barbie and Ken. The music was amazingly hilarious. The Ken battle scene cracked me up so much. Greta Gerwig is a phenomenal. I loved her version of Little Women and this is every bit as good. Barbie is a must see. Don't wait, go see it now!5 out of 10 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I really wanted to enjoy this and I know that I am not the target audience but there were massive plot holes and no real flow. The film was very disjointed. Ryan Gosling as good as he is seemed to old to play Ken and Will Ferrell ruined every scene he was in. I just didn't get it, it seemed hollow artificial and hackneyed. A waste of some great talent. It was predictable without being reassuring and trying so hard to be woke in the most superficial way in that but trying to tick so many boxes it actually ticked none. Margo Robbie looks beautiful throughout, the costumes and the sets were amazing but the story was way too weak and didn't make much sense at all.15 out of 22 found this helpful.

"When I first knew there was a Barbie movie in production, a live action, I thought ""It should be as bad as the others movies""... When I notice was Greta Gerwig making the movie, my expectation get higher. Then, when I saw the cast, my expectations were even higher!I went to watch this movie in the premiere and I can assure you this movie is a masterpiece.It's purposely not realistic, has an excellent director and an excellent production and story.There are lots of fun moments, but this movie is a satire to the life of Barbie.The fact that compares the dream life of Barbie to the real life in the real world it's fantastic. It's a never seen thing. It compares the women's mistreatment, the real tragedy's... it's a real good idea... Everything in this movie is really good. Go watch this movie. It deserves you attention.106 out of 391 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9,Barbie
"""If you brought a 7 year old girl to see this movie she would neither have fun nor be happy at all"" And this was my girlfriend's statement as soon as we left the cinema.I see it as an ok movie, occasionally very entertaining but overall chaotic, a bit cliché and even boring at times.Solid 6, i've seen worse but pales in comparison to The Lego Movie and other ""nostalgic intellectual property movies"" such as Mario Bros, which can contain deep messages without ruining the whole thing as I feel Barbie did.I have to give credit to the numerous exhilarating scenes with the Kens and the CEO, stereotyping done right IMHO.40 out of 69 found this helpful.

"In one sense, this film was more inevitable than Thanos. What do you get when you're part of a society that fuels existential crises, by constantly eroding definitions and structures? Barbie and Ken aren't exactly human (they don't even have genitals); they're embodied ideas, and so they face this amorphous crisis of identity that pits their presuppositional views of a happy society against that of the ""real world."" But their perception of the real world is like seeing a plane for the first time and therefore thinking it's a dragon. So how much can an audience glean from the pontifications of characters who are essentially children? I would have greatly preferred scriptwriters more well-versed in sociology as well as comedy, writers who understand not only American ideals, and how those ideals have shifted, but the role that Barbie has played along the way. I get the sense that the writers here just KNOW Barbie had some impact, without really understanding much beyond that. There was so much to explore, and it could have been shown situationally, rather than through heavy-handed exposition.Off-screen, apparently Ken had some interesting realizations about his misunderstandings of patriarchy, and Barbie had some realizations about how she treated Ken, but we don't get to see any of this nuance actually played out. Hugely missed opportunities there.Bottom line: As fantastic as Robbie and Gosling were, I wish this movie just didn't exist. Keep the cast, but try again with a much better script and director.16 out of 20 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",3,Barbie
"I tend to gravitate towards French cinema and the classics; the idea of watching a franchise movie about Barbie seemed mildly repellent at first. Well, I am glad I kept an open mind.This is a riotously funny, zany meta comedy with touches of Wes Anderson and Bollywood; yet also strangely affecting. The idea of giving a plastic doll an existential crisis may seem gimmicky, yet it works. The cracks showing in the perfect façade of the perfect Barbie world are rendered through metaphors that hit the mark, full of a strange melancholia. I am usually put off by sentimentalisms: here, thankfully, they are kept at a bare minimum, even in the ending.Overall, I am astonished this film exists at all. I imagine the authors meeting with a slightly distracted Mattel executive, being given a gazillion of dollars with the vaguest of briefs, and running away with it, to make a film that would send any corporate committee into a tailspin -- I imagine a first projection with the producers fainting and having a heart attack -- yet also make them laugh all the way to the bank. However it happened, chapeau. I am glad I went, I'll buy the dvd as well. I can see myself rewatching it to be sure I got all the micro gags and layers of meaning, but also putting it on when I need a little pick me up.19 out of 76 found this helpful.

"""Barbie"" is a comedy film based on the line of fashion dolls by Mattel. Directed and co-written by Greta Gerwig (""Lady Bird"", ""Little Women"") and starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, it takes every opportunity to revel in its amusing premise with a darkly satirical look at gender structure in society.In Barbieland, a matriarchal utopia where all women are successful, Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) lives a happy life spending time with her female friends and hanging out with her boyfriend Stereotypical Ken (Ryan Gosling). One night at a dance party, Stereotypical Barbie suddenly finds herself contemplating her own mortality and worries about what her future holds. The next day, Stereotypical Barbie discovers she is now unable to follow her usual routine, which results in her perfect skin breaking out in blemishes. After following advice from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), Stereotypical Barbie travels in her convertible to the real world to meet the child who plays with her, unaware that Stereotypical Ken has stowed away onboard.If you had to name a more iconic doll associated with little girls, I'm sure nearly everyone's first pick would be none other than Mattel's Barbie. Since first being launched back in 1959, Barbie has taken the world by storm, with the doll filling many different roles, including but not limited to a doctor, lawyer, astronaut, and even President of the United States. There have also been many movies made that star Barbie in leading roles, all of which have been CGI animated and released exclusively to video and streaming sites. Now adding to that catalogue, Greta Gerwig's live action cinematic feature titled simply ""Barbie"" is not only a fantastic send-up of gender roles but also a great comedy film in its own right that virtually everyone can enjoy regardless of age, gender, or political leaning.What could have been another generic film for parents to put on in the background to keep their young daughters quiet is actually one of the cleverest deconstructions of the world's view of the societal hierarchy since 2014's ""The LEGO Movie"". When we first see Barbieland, it is shown to be a bustling, exuberant paradise that is perfect for all of its inhabitants. That is, of course, only if you are a woman, and not one of the ""Kens"" where their enjoyment is based solely on being an accessory to the other ""Barbies"". It is obvious that this is a place where men cannot make a name for themselves, which sets in motion Stereotypical Ken's desire to travel with Stereotypical Barbie into the real world. Upon arriving, Ken learns that this new place is the mirror opposite of Barbieland, with real life society valuing patriarchy over matriarchy. In any normal instance, I would have rolled my eyes watching a movie allude to contentious political matters like this, but I quickly realised that the film is actually attacking both sides of the spectrum in the best way possible. In Barbieland, the matriarchy causes the women to exude toxic femininity towards men while in the real world we see the patriarchy make men show off their toxic masculinity towards women. Neither of these are glorified and where this film succeeds greatly is in the way it cleverly informs the audience that the extremes on both ends are what causes problems with society and that too much of either always leads to bad results.In addition to satirising gender norms, the film also functions as an amusing, gag-packed standalone comedy for casual viewers as well. There were a number of moments where I found myself laughing out loud at some of the jokes being made about the autonomous way Barbieland's populace live their lives. For instance, the Barbies are incapable of touching the ground with flat feet due to their default designs being made for high heel shoes. Also, the Kens are almost always seen at the beach awaiting instructions from the other Barbies, only for most of them to be ignored. However, some of the film's most hilarious parts occur when Barbie and Ken are in the real world, allowing for some humorous fish-out-of-water scenes involving their interactions with real people. There's even the occasional jab taken at Mattel themselves, parodying the commercialism surrounding Barbie and all her accessories. While not every single joke lands, there are so many of them that for every one that fails there are plenty of others that work just fine. In fact, without giving it away, this film has one of the funniest closing lines to a movie I've ever heard, so much so that it actually caught me off guard during my initial viewing.I also liked the practical production design of this movie, with minimal CG giving Barbieland a real toy-like aesthetic. As one might expect, the most prominently used colour here is pink. Nearly everything important in this world is pink - pink houses, pink beds, pink lamp posts, etc. Believe it or not, there was actually a worldwide shortage of pink paint due to the amount that was used to make this place look as authentically girly as possible. Later when Barbie and Ken are exploring the outside world, things look decidedly ordinary but since they are still wearing their brightly-coloured outfits, the two to stick out like a sore thumb from everybody else. It's rare for a film to effectively use its colour palette to evoke comedy so effectively and this one handles it in a way that all ages will understand it.As a Barbie girl living in her Barbie world, Margot Robbie is clearly having a great time portraying this stereotypical version of the iconic doll. The fact that there's nothing especially noteworthy about this specific Barbie means that she has the most room to grow as a character. Robbie's Barbie is friendly, fun-loving, but blissfully ignorant of what her boyfriend Ken truly wants with her. Though not outright malicious, she inadvertently makes Ken feel unwanted due to her conditioned attitude towards all the other Kens in her world. What I liked best about Robbie's performance was the way she shows an open-mindedness to the character. She is curious about what type of world lies beyond Barbieland and whether things will be the same or different to what she is used to. It would have been easy to have made this Barbie a man-hating blonde bimbo with no capacity for independent thought but rather she remains pleasant towards everyone and is willing to learn about new experiences on her journey.Whether intentional or not, I think Ryan Gosling's version of Ken steals the movie practically every time he is shown on screen. Maybe it's because I'm so used to seeing Gosling play stoic, subdued roles but watching him come to life as this version of Barbie's boyfriend was quite a surprise. Although this isn't the first comedic role Gosling has played, it is here that he effectively demonstrates all the humorous possibilities he is capable of as an actor. We watch Ken try to surf at the beach as a means to impress Barbie, only to realise he cannot ""swim"" in the placemat water. Later, he tries to apply for certain jobs in the real world based solely on his gender, but is told that he needs proper qualifications in order to be taken seriously by employers. There's just something about the way Gosling is able to showcase such loveable pathos as Ken that makes you want to see how he can become more than just the generic partner of his more famous girlfriend.From the perspective of a 30-something heterosexual man who has never once expressed interest in playing with dolls, the film ""Barbie"" pulls off the miraculous task of transcending above its stereotypical audience of young girls to appeal to all viewers instead. It offers an observant satire about the world's views on gender roles while also functioning as an amusing comedy film packed with jokes galore. No matter what your general opinion on Barbie may be, whether you love her as an entertaining toy or hate her because you don't care for what she represents, this movie has you covered on both fronts. In that regard, this film has done its job.I rate it a solid 9.26 out of 134 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9,Barbie
"I was really surprised about how much i liked Ryan Gosling in this. I had totally forgot about his comedic talent and timing. The movie works. There is definitely a moral message in this, even though I believe the majority of viewers will be too distracted by Margot Robbie and Ryan Goslings great performances and all of the comedy elements in this and the fact that the script is hardly worth being filmed. I feel like with a different script they could have created something truly great.Over all it's a fun family movie to enjoy together. I watched this and afterwards Oppenheimer last night and I am truly glad I did it in that order, because I doubt that I would have been able to enjoy this even nearly as much if I had watched Oppenheimer first.42 out of 76 found this helpful.

"I'm not someone who often watches comedies, so they don't make me laugh much, but if they all became as funny as Barbie, I might give it another go.Because I really laughed out loud during the film.It did away perfectly with the comedy and the moralizing, a bit deeper, philosophical stuff.Of course, the soundtrack is top-notch, the sets are breathtaking and there's Ryan Gosling: the main reason I came.In addition to all that, this film is a good critic of patriarchal rule, without overdoing it. It questions gender roles in a fluid way, and brings existential questions to the fore.By the way, I don't understand the opinions of those who didn't like the film because it promoted feminism. Whereas Barbie is literally an invention designed to make women feel as important as men in society, to break down stereotypes and glorify gender equality.Ok whatever, go and see it, it's worth it.83 out of 324 found this helpful.

"The first half was pretty enjoyable, fun, light, but it took itself too seriously by the second half. No longer allowing the talented cast, especially Gosling, to shine and make us laugh. It felt like the talents of Will Ferrell and Michael Cera were also somewhat underutilized. Interesting concept, had potential, but later in the movie, it definitely started to fall flat for me.Ryan Gosling definitely held this movie together for me, without the laughs he gave me, it would've definitely been lower than 6. I think there was just too much of a push to bring politics into the movie. Some is fine, but it enveloped the movie entirely by the end. Whether or not any of the political stuff was accurate, it felt forced and out of place.32 out of 46 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6,Barbie
"Greta Gerwig's Barbie explores creation myths in Barbieland, a parallel universe populated by Mattel dolls. The director uses the toy conglomerate's vast archive and successful products as tools to create a rich and weird material. The movie is a clever send-up of Barbie dolls and their legacy, featuring light-hearted jokes that poke fun at Mattel, the doll's lore, and the contradictions of our sexist society. The director's storytelling is impressive, and the film's humor is both lighthearted and chuckle-worthy. Gerwig's Barbieland, created by Sarah Greenwood and Jacqueline Durran, is a pink fever dream with funky compositions by Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt, bubblegum anthems by Dua Lipa, Nicki Minaj, and Ice Spice. The film features plastic trees and identical two-story Barbie dream homes, with flying being the preferred mode of transportation. The production design and costuming are exceptional, showcasing Gerwig's passion for details and her ability to create a dreamlike world. Barbieland is a feminist utopia in which Barbies serve as presidents, Supreme Court members, doctors, physicists, Nobel prize winners, and cancer cures. The dolls are not structurally different from our world, but they are represented by political fantasy and decade-dependent what-ifs. Barbie has gone to space, could vote, and own property before many human women, and her appearance has changed to mirror society's beauty politics. The representational doll has become an extension of political fantasy, reflecting the beauty politics of society. Gerwig features a cast of Barbies, including Issa Rae, Emma Mackey, Alexandra Shipp, and Hari Nef. Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) is the protagonist, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed Barbie created by Ruth Handler. Her Ken counterpart, Ryan Gosling, is portrayed with humor and heart. They are a version of Eve and Adam, with their fall being dramatic. Barbie finds her perfect life hampered by existential thoughts and seeks answers from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a doll with a traumatic history. Stereotypical Barbie, with Ken, heads to real-world Los Angeles to find her little girl. The relationship between Barbies and their human owners is tenuously outlined, so it's best not to think too deeply about how it all works. Robbie's performance in Gerwig's Barbie highlights the tension between Barbie as an object and subject. Her expressive eyes and physical presence reveal the human world's forces, while her rigid presence in Barbieland suggests she's not less rigid in the real world. Despite the director's skill in capturing deeper themes, the film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest it ultimately serves a brand. The film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest the film serves as a brand. Gerwig's film Barbieland is a mix of fun and emotional depth, with a tension between keeping Barbie entertaining and blending her source material with previous projects. After a detour, Barbie returns home to find Ken's patriarchal knowledge has transformed Barbieland. The screenplay, by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, avoids familiarity and mockery, but the moments that aren't just funny are buried in important monologues, making the gestures feel politically hollow. The film's mandate is too ambitious, making it feel politically hollow.30 out of 170 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"I had no idea what to expect going into Barbie. I had no interest in seeing a movie about Barbie but was immediately sold on the highly talented Margot Robbie and the awesome Ryan Gosling. But I was still nervous that the comedy would be aimed strictly at women and would be difficult for a guy to enjoy.To my surprise, I didn't feel that at all. This movie is hilarious. It's the kind of stupid-funny I love, the kind usually reserved for ""dude movies."" Something you're more likely to see in a Will Ferrell movie. I was not aware Ryan Gosling could be so funny.Even though the majority of the movie is silly and fun, Margot Robbie still gives a great performance, as usual. She continues to prove she's a star. And most of the supporting cast are welcomed additions.I found Barbie highly entertaining. I think most will enjoy it, except maybe guys who are sensitive to anything empowering women or making fun of men. That's not me. The parts that made me laugh the most are the jokes about the guys.(1 viewing, early fan screening UltraScreen 7/19/2023)33 out of 104 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Brilliantly written by Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach. Everyone in this is fantastic. It's a wink at nostalgia and commentary on society. Never played with Barbies but my daughter did. Tribute to the inventor of Barbie, Ruth Handler. Helen Mirren narrates. Kate McKinnon almost steals the movie. Not a movie for little kids but most of the references will probably go over their heads. My girlfriend and I laughed out loud many times. It's about 20 minutes too long for my taste. The music is spot on. It's a perfect summer movie. Guess what? It has value and substance. Margot Robbie is not only gorgeous but more importantly, she's highly intelligent as actor and producer. This movie is going to make bank!13 out of 51 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Unfortunately, most reviews that I've read here that score this film poorly explain so clearly that the reviewer did not understand the message of the film. It is not anti-men, it does not portray men as ""stupid"". Take a moment to think about how women have been portrayed in movies over the last century - oh yes, just as Ken is here! The movie exaggerates this, yes. That is the point. To clearly (and humourously) highlight the inequalities when the roles are reversed. Stop being offended by something that isn't offensive and take a bit of time to actually think about the film that you have watched.The film was fun, emotional, moving, sad and empowering in many ways. I must admit I hadn't expected to enjoy this film, but wow, what a surprise!41 out of 116 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9,Barbie
"I am a MASSIVE and lifelong Barbie fanatic. I went in to this movie absolutely pumped. I came out of the movie blown away. Typical of Barbie, she blew me away with the absolute depth of her message. America Ferrera's monologue in Barbie Land had people clapping in the theatre. I appreciated it as a Mother, daughter, sister, wife and human being. The truth bombs she dropped got me right in the feels. I know. You are likely rolling your eyes and balking at the sheer IDEA that a BARBIE movie could be in any way profound. I say to you, you must not REALLY know Barbie then. This really was, if I think about it, in true Barbie fashion. Well done, my lady. Well done.2 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Dont fall for the 5 star reviews. This movie is extremely boring and goes on without a purpose even if it has it's hard to understand.Good humour but when they don't have anything to say they sing songs. Basically a musical movie, reminds me of High School Musical.Margot Robbie is amzing but Ryan Gosling steals the show not with his looks but his acting. He's the one who was gripping the movie. You will get to know about lot of Barbie you didnt know about.There will be moments where you'll be like whats going on? Why am i here ? Why didn't i book the tickets for oppenheimer early but this too shall pass.71 out of 118 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6,Barbie
"Barbie is a delightful and creatively refreshing comedy that breathes new life into the iconic doll's world. From the moment the film began, I was captivated by its smart and subversive storytelling, which cleverly blends meta-humour with a dash of eccentricity.The production design is a standout feature, a visually dazzling and wonderfully pink-themed universe. Margot Robbie's portrayal of Barbie is nothing short of impressive, skilfully capturing both the character's earnestness and humour. Her performance, combined with Greta Gerwig's skilful directing, makes for a truly entertaining and memorable experience.Throughout the film, I found myself chuckling at the witty humour and enjoying the unexpectedly bold take on what Barbie represents. The movie strikes a fine balance between honouring the iconic brand and playfully challenging its conventions, resulting in a unique and rewarding cinematic experience.While the film's intentions are commendable, there were moments when it felt like the themes could have been explored more deeply, leaving me slightly wanting more. Nonetheless, Barbie remains a fun and enjoyable ride, filled with charm and charismatic performances that made it stand out as one of the year's best comedies so far.In the end, Barbie proves to be much more than just a marketing gimmick, showcasing a refreshing take on a beloved cultural icon and making it a must-see for anyone seeking a smart, humorous, and visually arresting cinematic adventure.26 out of 128 found this helpful.

"Here's the thing.In my eyes BARBIE happens at the beginning of the movie. Amazingly created world with great looks and surprises now and then. Lovely! But then it feels like all about BARBIE is forgotten within seconds except for the pink color of course. The movie turns into a quite weird direction with happenings that are very sought and often don't make any sense at all. Suddenly everyone can jump around between two worlds and no one thinks that's crazy actually.Suddenly the difference between Kens, Barbies and Human beings is gone away ALTHOUGH in the beginning it shows definite differences like feet or fingers that aren't separate. Later on Ken plays the guitar and can move every single finger for example. All in all the great love for detail from the beginning is gone quite fast and turns into a long childish and boring battle between manly men and fimaly females. It starts to look like the TV-show Love Island. A loud unnecessary back and forth between genders. At the end a try of a deep scene to let go a few deep words and that's it. The movie teaches nothing to take home with. It's more like the name BARBIE was abused for this one in my eyes.7 out of 10 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Only Greta Gerwig can pull this movie off. She is the only one that can helm this movie right. No other directors can do what she did for this movie. Why? Because the others would end up making this movie as generic or as plain as possible aka 'just another commercial blockbuster movie'. Greta Gerwig was able to turn the wheels from the overly used direction, venturing into new territories most directors are afraid to go.Barbie the Movie sends out strong messages and contexts about a lot of different things. Some of them include patriarchy, male-dominated world, female-dominated world, perfectionism, teenage-phase life, adulting, gender equality, equity, sexual objectifications amongst many others. Now, you must be shocked to hear all of this are conveyed in this film. A Barbie film that talks about all this stuff? YES. This is Greta's X-Factor, having to bring these sensitive subjects into a movie for everyone catered for all audiences. And children will still be entertained and understood with the story and the messages that Barbie brings to the table.Verdict: Filled with contexts and messages as rich as Oscar-nominated films, Barbie the Movie is a whole different game as it is full with surprises and hard-hitting truths about the world we live in today. It is self-aware of what it is and Greta Gerwig daringly takes charge of crafting a masterpiece storytelling that capitalizes on the heavy subjects without downgrading anything or anyone, maintaining both its quality and substance the entire film. You'll appreciate this 'life in plastic' film more than you can ever imagine. 💗25 out of 126 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8,Barbie
"For me, Barbie came very, very close to an 8 rating. The only reason it didn't quite get there was that it contains a few scenes that are too long and a bit too weak.On the plus side, there are several more things to mention. First and foremost, Barbie has attracted a very strong cast, with well respected names also in several supporting roles, and they all perform well. Margot Robbie was almost an obvious casting choice. With her skills and her appearance, she really IS Barbie (with a brain) for almost two hours.Director Greta Gerwig and her crew created perfect Barbieland sets, which made me smile in spite of the fact that I never owned a Barbie doll myself.The film had me laughing many times, and it also brought me to tears a few times. Quite impressive for a movie about a doll, I thought.And, last but not least, the message of the movie. Already when I heard that Greta Gerwig was going to make a Barbie movie, I knew we were in for a culture clash. The fact that she went all-in was not surprising to me, but that she managed to convince Mattel to go along with her was. Kudos not only to Greta Gerwig for that, but also to Mattel. This may turn out to prove enormously profitable for them in the end, and they undoubtedly hope to make Barbie relevant for a few more generations. Nevertheless, this took guts on their part. Well played.41 out of 125 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7,Barbie
"I wanted to love this movie but it just wasn't it :(It was nothing that hasn't been done before. It didn't really say anything. I hate using the word woke, but hearing the same talking points is tiring. We understand, the patriarchy is bad. But I didn't go to this movie to be preached to.I was hoping it would be a bit more camp. I was expecting it to be like the Barbie animated films you get, which ngl, are usually good. This was far from that.The ending was also a bit dragged out. It was trying very hard to be profound and it wasn't working.I didn't care for any of the characters much either and was a little sad to not see Raquelle or any of Barbie's sisters apart from Skipper.Apart from the criticism, I thought the costume design was really well executed. Margot Robbie looked fabulous at all times.204 out of 308 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",4,Barbie
"I'm not one of those people who feel the need to apologize for watching 'Barbie'. In my opinion there are no bad movie genres, there are only good movies and bad movies. And the cinema is also popular entertainment, and buying a big bowl of popcorn and sitting in the air-conditioned theater to watch a musical comedy that features some of the most talented actors of the moment can't be the worst thing on a hot summer day. 'Barbie', Greta Gerwig's film did not make me regret the decision to watch it for at least three quarters of its duration.Barbie lives in an ideal world called Barbieland. Actually, I should use the plural, but I don't really know how, because it's not just about the blonde doll we all know, but about all the incarnations she has received over the decades - blondes and brunettes, with white, yellow, black or other skin colors, thinner or bigger. The multiple Barbies have the most diverse professions, from doctor to Nobel laureate writer, from astronaut to president of the United States. Ultimately, the Barbie universe was imagined to give courage and self-confidence to little girls and instill in them the idea that anything is possible. There are also boys, they are generally called Ken, but their purpose is to be the Barbies' (asexual) partners when those are willing to pay attention to them. The introduction to the film is excellent, with a quote from Kubrick's 'A Space Odyssey' and voiceovers narrated by Helen Mirren. When stereotypical blonde Barbie starts getting into trouble, the source is in the real world. Barbie must face reality and the conflict between universes is inevitable. The real world is not like the ideal world and the mixture of them will cause a revolution in Barbieland that will not necessarily be in the right direction. The awakening to reality or, if you will, the humanization of Barbie comes at a price.'Barbie' - the movie works well most of the time, especially when the focus is on the comedic and musical side and the message is integrated into the entertainment. The production is excellent. The sets, the costumes, the cinematography will surely receive Academy Awards nominations, and in some categories 'Barbie' may be the winner. The soundtrack reminds at some points fragments from the history of the pop and ballad genres of the 70s and 80s. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are excellent in the lead roles and I wouldn't be surprised if Barbie dolls borrow their faces (if they haven't already). The messages are well-punched and come across the screen quite well - genuine and fake feminism and the way Barbie products reflect society's conception of the place, role and appearance of women, the more or less camouflaged misogyny of contemporary society, corporations with their seemingly socially aligned messages camouflaging capitalist greed. All of this is well dosed and combined with what happens on screen until the final part of the film, when either the writers took themselves a little too seriously, or they did not have enough inspiration and instead of continuing to infuse the dissolved messages into entertainment they resorted to rhetoric and created an ending that I found forced and didactic. 'Barbie' was worth seeing for the fun part, for the colours, music and humour. When playing with dolls it is good not to be overly serious.11 out of 63 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Never have I ever experienced this much fun during a movie. Every actor played its part perfectly. With enough self-awerness, humour and silly moments this was everything I hoped for. The budget was also insane, I can't wait to rewatch this so I can look at all the details again. The way Barbie moves, walks, drinks, acts?? Perfection.Also surprisingly emotional, I didn't expect to cry during a movie about a doll. But well wel well, it happened.Anyway, it deserves all the hype. Margot Robbie IS Barbie, there is nobody who could've done the role justice like her.And Ryan? Well, he's just Ken.171 out of 522 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I absolutely loved the barbie movie, the movie had such a beautiful message and Margot is just exceptional.The world is so colourful , the characters are all fantastic.A great film for any barbie fan.Kate McKinnon and America Ferrera are stand outs as well.There will be people who cast judgment for the sake of being negative but I truly, genuinely think that most will enjoy this film.The full cast of the film are just perfect.Go check them it out, take your friends and make a night of it , can guarantee you will absolutely enjoy yourself.Will definitely see it again and can't wait for the DVD. Hope there is a stack of special features.43 out of 193 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"I loved the music , and the fun start.A bit of cheeky humor , and dance choreography.The story was quite confusing, it felt like being glued with superglue and not consistent from the beginning to the end . The ending was quite weird . And switching between the two worlds of the story did not make much sense . The character from the Mattel management did not add any value to the story . If they were edited out , I think no one would even notice a difference .The main male character has done a good job , especially in his macho phase .The female main character was lovely . Absolutely gorgeous and well played .12 out of 21 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7,Barbie
"There is first in every thing.And there's the first on a new thing.Greta Gerwig has never disappointed me. Even when she was at her point with the mumblecore genre. Now she bring her class and weirdness to a new top level.With Barbie Greta make the viewers never distracted but confused, in such a glam and fun colorful wave.Greta has done perfectly the accuracy and portrayal of certain dolls and places in Barbie's fabulous and magic world. Additionally, the pacing and storytelling choices feeling that it may bring directly in your cinemas the wonderful, fun, witty and very magic world that is the one of Barbie.45 out of 294 found this helpful.

Barbie is basically exactly what we need right now. A hilarious summer blockbuster with a social commentary nuanced enough to allow young ones to enjoy but present enough for you to get something out of it. Margot Robbie is brilliant and a perfect Barbie. Gosling shows off his incredible comedic talent more than ever.Most all the jokes land well. It's clear that the actors understood Gerwig's vision and Gerwig and Baumbach's script. Set and costume design are on another level in Barbie. The distinction between Barbieland and the real world is done very well thanks to set design.See Barbie!2 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink,7,Barbie
"My mother was the only person I could convince to go watch Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" (2023) with me, and ""wow"" am I glad we went. It's been a while since I've seen such a genuinely fun and creative movie. Originality is what the world has been longing for!The story is clever and manages to be remain lightheaded and witty, while also conveying influential messages for- and challenging the audience with questions about modern feminism and discovering who you really want to be, no matter who you are.This film is colorful and 'alive', making it a joy to view upon. The set pieces, especially in Barbieland, are brilliant- and it truly makes me want to know if they actually built out a real-life Barbieland set. Did they?!The acting was brilliant from everyone; you could tell they were all having a lot of enjoyment on set. Margot Robbie carried this film for sure, as one can come to expect from this modern superstar. It was also enlightening to see Ryan Gosling take on such a comical role while also bringing a lot of depth to the character. He has a great sense of comedic timing and humor. From what I've seen in interviews, Ryan is basically embracing his comedic genius and I love it.I usually despise singing and dancing in movies, but in this film it put a smile on my face. Not just because it was amusing to watch, but because these people can actually perform really well on these fronts. It goes without saying that the music for this film was on point as well.I highly recommend everyone to go see this film, though maybe don't watch it directly before or after ""Oppenheimer"" in case you're following the current trend. Let both films sink in for a bit because they each deserve the attention.23 out of 111 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8,Barbie
"I had great expectations for the Barbie movie, mainly because of the writers (Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach) and the stellar cast with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling leading the way. Unfortunately I found myself disappointed, bored and shocked by some messages the movie tries to convey.Starting with what I liked, the performances were great and in particular Ryan Gosling was spectacular with a wide range of emotions and a lot of humor displayed. Also the design of the sets was inspired with a lot of references to the Barbie world and the style was unique and recognisable. Finally some jokes landed pretty well and the movie (in the first half) is pretty funny. And the positives end here.Unfortunately the negatives are much more important. Sorted in a order of increasing gravity: * some plot lines are bad and are closed so quickly that it would have been better not to include them in the first place. In particular I am referring to the mother/daughter one and the one about Mattel. Furthermore, the Mattel one is also a bit strange since it is useful to criticise however uses feminism to make money, while being a movie that does exactly that.* the film becomes boring in the second half. This is due to a systematic shift in tone and style since if in the first part the satire is sharp and elegant and leads to numerous bittersweet laughs, in the second half instead the movie becomes full of exposition. There are a lot of scenes where things are directly explained to the viewer (clearly considered a bit stupid) and there are some too long monologues that are both cringe and painfully written. This is a pity because some ideas explored in the second half are interesting, but due to this shift ""Barbie"" becomes so boring to enjoy them.* the messages: I found some messages the movie is trying to convey pretty baffling. First of all the film is not about parity, but rather about gender fight and I don't think this is the correct idea to give to younger viewers. I want that children/young adults get that as a society we want equal rights and opportunities, not to fight to be the dominant genere. This is also true because of the fact that there's no a single positive male figure throughout the movie because they are all treated like enemies or like total idiots. On the other side the Barbies are perfect entities. In a certain way it seemed ""Birds of Prey"" where the situation was exactly the same but in that case there weren't two of the biggest writer in Hollywood behind. Not to mention the totally worst thing that is how the Barbie solve the main conflict: instead of using intelligence they use seduction. This is so wrong because in a movie that wants to be empowering, women are depicted as better suited in seducing instead of thinking. All of these ruin other good ideas like for instance the inversion of the point of view that is useful to explain to men what women in our society has to live every day. That was pretty interesting but it gets lost between what mentioned before.In conclusion, I was very disappointed by the ""Barbie"" movie because I actually had high hopes knowing that it could have been a fun movie with positive messages, but it was the total opposite. I've seen it with both females and males and the reactions were generally mixed and no gender pattern was evidenced in terms of appreciating it or not. However the great merit that I have to give credit to the movie is that it triggers a discussion capable of actually enrich people through sharing of experiences. And so, even if I didn't like it I'd suggest you to watch ""Barbie"" and discuss of it with your families and friends!29 out of 41 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"This movie is an intelligence test. I saw many comments how people're describing the movie attacks men. It actually doesn't. I am a man, maybe even a stereotypical one - I loved Sigma Ken part, it was hilarious. I have a degree in Economics and love to work out in the gym, watching action movies, dark jokes, drink not cheap beers...I believe the movie told a full of heart story how both sides (men and women) should team work more! The story perfectly told in a satirical way explains in what areas we all struggle. I won't go deep dive in because my short review doesn't contain any spoilers but trust me, the movie tries to be supportive and share a thoughtful and warm message in a fun way. It isn't woke, it doesn't treat the audience like a dumbass, it doesn't tokenise anybody, it doesn't force anything. It represents people lost in the world, trying to find their place and I think it says: Chill out.Don't be mad. Go there with open heart and mind and have fun because I did. Ryan Gosling was fantastic.22 out of 79 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9,Barbie
"The colors, shots, houses, clothes were really amazingly done. Margot and Rayan were amazing, beautiful and acted well. I will say that. I find that the movie wasn't THAT good. The story wasn't as entertaining as it could. This was supposed to be like a childrens show with adult humor and topics but I didnt find most of the jokes funny, i felt like they were just screaming stuff in your face instead of being more subtle. I wish some aspects of the characters and side stories were explored more. The ending was okay but i wished for something diffrent and again more about the side characters. Ken is a cool character i gotta say. He deserves the world and to really find something more about him. So i wouldn't say it was a bad movie, its okay to watch more casually, more so to appreciate the dolls and the nostalgia. I was lowkey dissapointment with all the hype i gotta say.Ps. I find it weird that this is considered such a ""woke"" movie but did not mention that boys can play with dolls ONCE. Like cmon I had a Barbie too!7 out of 13 found this helpful.

"I'm not even joking when I say this was the most moving film I've ever seen. Going into this I expected the outcome to be one of two things: either is was going to be very dumb and bad, or it would be absolutely amazing. No in between. And now, I can confidently say that it was absolutely amazing. It made me laugh, it made me tear up, it made me feel so much more than I ever could have expected a movie about Barbies, or any toys in general, to make me feel. I genuinely believe that it is going to be one of the most influential movies of this generation.Before I get into why specifically I loved it so much, I would like to first say that to the men out there that are calling this movie ""man-hating,"" you could not be more wrong. If you think that, then clearly you went in with your own preconceived notions and did not pay enough attention to the message of the movie. I also am a man and this movie delivered a beautifully written feminist message that depicted unfair societal stereotypes placed onto women and proved the reasons why the patriarchy is truly a bad thing. Just because it did that, does not make it man-hating, especially since it also depicted and drew awareness to negative societal pressure placed onto men and their emotions.Now, onto why I really loved this movie. First off, it was very funny and light hearted at exactly the right points. I liked that it left room for dramatic scenes that could really tug at the heart strings and Margot Robbie in particular delivered a very powerful performance. Yes, she had great comedic timing, but her talent really showed in more emotional scenes where Barbie felt she had to still act like her happy smiley self despite the overwhelming sadness she was feeling. Not only that, but the costumes and sets were immaculate. It was not only well written and acted, but clearly a lot of care went into the movie from the crew. Each character, even despite their limited screen time, was fleshed out and everyone did a great job making their characters unique and different from each other.This movie made me think so much. I had to let it fester in my brain for a few days before writing a review because I had so many thoughts. I know many people wished it was more light hearted at times, but I am so glad it wasn't, because if it was, it never could have been as powerful and emotional for me. The writers and directors could have taken a more silly, childish approach, but instead they decided upon a story that could make the world a better place, and I have to commend that.Overall, the Barbie Movie was so much more than I ever could have expected it to be and I urge anyone who hasn't yet to go watch it, especially if you have an open mind and, most importantly, an open heart. As of right now, my rating is a 9, but I definitely think it will increase once I inevitably watch it again. I think this movie has the potential to do a lot of good for the world.11 out of 48 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9,Barbie
"So I headed to the cinema to watch Barbie, the new live-action adaptation of the beloved doll franchise. I had high hopes. Unfortunately, it fell short. Barbie takes us on a journey, with Margot Robbie portraying ""Stereotypical"" Barbie as she leaves her world of Barbieland and enters the Real World. She encounters friends, overcomes challenges, and discovers important lessons about herself and others. Barbie doesn't always hit the mark while attempting to blend comedy, drama and fantasy elements. The plot feels predictable and filled with clichés, and the theme and tone are sometimes inconsistent and confusing. The acting and characters come across as stereotypes (something expected in Barbieland but not in the Real World).Nevertheless, Greta Gerwig's direction is skilful and imaginative; Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt's music is catchy and uplifting; Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is vibrant with a burst of colours. The movie also incorporates intriguing symbolism and production design by contrasting Barbie's sparkly world with the realism of the Real World. The animation breathes life into Barbie's world on screen. Amidst it all are some moments accompanied by clever dialogue-particularly from Ken (played by Ryan Gosling), who, as you would expect, serves as Barbie's trusty sidekick, desperately wanting to be noticed and appreciated by Barbie.I had some issues with the movie because it only scratched the surface when exploring its themes. Throughout the story, Barbie touched on topics like death, unattainable perfection, gender roles, body image and self-esteem. However, it merely skimmed over these issues superficially, like snacking on junk food instead of having a substantial meal.Barbie isn't a masterpiece. It's not a disaster, either. It's an entertaining film for kids and adults. The movie attempts to convey a message about embracing oneself and accepting others. It doesn't do so convincingly or in an original way. It left me feeling amused and bored.Cute but shallow.3 out of 6 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6,Barbie
"Barbie (2023) is a fantasy comedy film directed by Greta Gerwig and co-written by her and Noah Baumbach, based on the iconic fashion dolls by Mattel. The film stars Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, who go on a journey of self-discovery after their expulsion from Barbieland, a matriarchal society where all women are successful and independent. Along the way, they encounter various challenges and surprises in the real world, a multifaceted exploration of existentialism, consumerism, and femininity.Barbie 2023 is a delightful and refreshing film that celebrates Barbie as a cultural icon and a role model for girls and women of all ages. It is incredibly funny and smart, with a terrific ensemble cast that all go for it in the best ways. It is also a clever and creative film that explores various themes and issues that are relevant and relatable to today's society. It is a film that can appeal to a wide range of audiences, from fans of Barbie to fans of comedy to fans of cinema. It is a film that deserves to be seen and enjoyed on the big screen. Give Gosling the Oscar AND the Grammy!12 out of 63 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8,Barbie
"Barbie was an entertaining movie, but was definitely not worth the hype that accompanied the film. The messages the movie wanted to share were so on the nose and explicit that it became jarring and weird. The movie also meandered from place to place and didn't seem to have a purpose for the majority of its run time.Ryan Gosling was hilarious though and stole every scene he was in. Several of the cameos were also great.Had fun, but wouldn't really recommend it as a 'must watch'. Mostly watched it as the first part of the Barbenheimer meme, so it was worth it for that reason at least.7.12 out of 29 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I loved this movie so much. It's so effortlessly funny with the end being heartfelt and quite sad. The soundtrack is amazing including one of my favorite songs by billie eilish ""what was i made for."" The song is so amazing and finishes off the movie in the best way possible.Barbie took a very unexpected turn of events that did not appear in the trailer (i think this is a good thing) and was full of plot twists that thickened the storyline.It is great for all ages and genders as it has a lot of relatable characters.Overall i think it is a movie to definitely add to your watchlist and go see in your nearest cinema!!10 out of 24 found this helpful.

"""Barbie"" is a movie that is setting all sorts of records, so it's obvious that the film is touching many people. For some, it's the fun of seeing a doll come to life, for others it's the theme of empowerment that make the movie a big hit. As for me, I did like it and thought it was a pretty good movie...but it's not for everyone.The first 2/3 of the film are simply fun and a visual delight. Seeing all the Barbie's in Barbieland was a joy. It also was very nice seeing Barbie enter the real world and interact with all the unfamiliar aspects of it. As for the final third, for me, this is what hurt the film a bit...at least for some viewers. Why? Well, I loved its message of female empowerment but I also felt it was delivered like a sledgehammer. Instead of talking about it and getting on with the plot, the movie bogged down for me and seemed to keep making the same point repeatedly. Subtle, it was not. On the other hand, who am I to complain...I did like the movie and am glad it had a nice feminist bent. Obviously this worked for many women seeing the film. Overall, a very good movie that slowed to a crawl towards the end. Not bad...but a film I wanted to like more than I actually did.2 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"While the production value, cinematography and acting were what you would expect from Margo Robbie and the supporting cast. I felt the movie fell short of not preaching to me and spreading a message of division rather than unity. Men and women cannot survive without each other but you'd never know it watching this movie. And me having my 13 year old daughter with me almost caused me to walk out of the theater. I kept on waiting for the writers to hit the direction of unity but it never came. After the movie my daughter brought up the message to me saying how she even noticed the weird agenda they're trying to push and said that is not a movie for the easily impressionable. Come to find out my daughter is better suited to take on the world that I thought she was. Proud day for me as a father.109 out of 165 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Barbie: the symbol of pink, pastel perfection. An iconic piece of American pop culture for more than 50 years. But nothing can prepare you for her big screen debut.Barbie is a risky and courageous new movie. This is a film that will be discussed and talked about for years to come. Greta Gerwig takes Matel's historic creation, every triumph and failure in its catalogue, and places it all within a complicated and challenging critique of what it means to be a woman. If I could compare it to another movie, I would say it's very reminiscent of Robert Townsend's Hollywood Shuffle. It leaves you wondering what kind of insane negotiations went between the film's creative team and Matel, who is also one the targets of the film's purposeful ire. It is one thing to have completed this film, and absolutely another for it to have also gotten the overwhelming promotional campaign in the months leading up to its release. Gerwig's bet is paying off big time, and you have to admit, that takes a lot of guts.Concept alone certainly isn't the film's only strength. The film is beautiful to look at. The production design is second to none in its meticulous construction of a real-life Barbie paradise. Respectively, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling give fantastic performances with plenty of complexity and dimension. I was the most touched by Rhea Perlman who gives a heartwarming portrayal of the founding mother of Barbieland, Ruth Handler. Gerwig and Baumbauch's screenplay is biting and irreverent, and by the end, nobody is left unscathed. But equally so, I belly laughed quite often and marveled at how well so many of the jokes land. The emotional depth of the film also struck a very powerful cord, complete with an ending montage that can practically leave anyone misty-eyed.Having been released on the same day as Oppenheimer, it's safe to say that the event movie is back and better than ever. After three years of streaming, it can't be overstated how wonderful that is.3 out of 14 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8,Barbie
"It is a philosophical masterpiece. Clever and thought provoking, hilarious and modern. I didn't expect that at all. The constructed reality is as complex as if Morpheus from ""the Matrix"" offered you the third pill which conjoins two worlds. Deserves the hypeI hope I don't dive super deep here, if I say that the beginning reminds me of Wlater Benjamin's ""Berlin Childhood"". Playing with toys knows to be joyful and lucid, but really reats some new and confusing ""realty"". To add up, this movie seems to be much more philosophical than ""The Matrix"", I would say. That dimension opens up right afterer ""blue pill vs red pill"" reference was made, because here we hd those two realities colide, ""imagenary"" and ""real*, creating the conjoined ""third realm"" where we see how both realites influence and shape each other. As Slavoj Zizek once pointed out: ""we need a third pill"", so here it is.At that point in the movie, story takes a new turn bringing into the focus some familiar social & existential struggles of modern times, providing us with its own critique of it. And it llooks like they had great success doing it. Seemingly effortlessly, they manged to bring out some greater point, keeping the great dynamics, adding the great amount of comedy to it. That was actually so impressive.Here ill pull the breaks, I would rather not to try to explain the movie or interprete it, .. Just wanna to say in the end that I strongly rrecommend it for watching. It's fun, profound, its reveling and bringing out so many different layers talking about the social/existential dilemas and actually you can learn much from watching it. And In the end, it gives the right amount of optimism.67 out of 250 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Barbie was a very fun, light-hearted, over-the-top movie that takes you on a wild journey. The fact that it paid homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey's opening sequence earned it extra points for me! Ryan Gosling was great and Margot Robbie was perfectly cast, and the production design was fantastic. A comedy movie should mainly be judged on its comedy, and Barbie for the most part is actually quite funny! I also loved how the narrator speaks over the movie at certain points and delivers some funny lines. This may get some backlash, but I feel Barbie is a movie that earns popularity because it propagates feminist ideals and speaks to the issues women face today, and audiences are willing to look past its flaws to celebrate the movie because the message it portrays is very relevant in society today. I feel the same way with Sound of Freedom. Just because a movie talks about issues you care about, however important they may be, doesn't mean it's the ""greatest movie of all time"" and ""Oscar-worthy"" etc. The plot of Barbie seemed quite interesting to me, how Barbie goes into the real world and the chaos that could cause. But I feel like the movie got TOO drenched in the social commentary and thus didn't give the creative plot idea enough justice. Movies don't have to be so explicit with the social commentary, as shown by movies like 12 Angry Men (1957), which IMO does a far better job at tackling racism and prejudice than any film made today. At certain times, Barbie really blurred the line between being anti-patriarchy and being anti-men. It felt like it was fighting injustice with more injustice, although not throughout.12 out of 26 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7,Barbie
"Barbie is a movie that you start laughing of the critics that are put in such an intelligent way (you have to think fast between laughs), amazed by the idea of a perfect world and suddenly they start to go in your feelings and bring out so many realizations about yourself with funny dialogs. We never goin to forget what it is see Margot and Ryan such an incredible performance the way them put so many emotions and still keep that doll mindset is brilliant and for Greta all my reverence it's breathtaking think that she decided to go up front with such strong movie and we didn't expect anything different from her. Oscar winners here we go.11 out of 21 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Barbie wasn't supposed to be that deep but it was. Greta Gerwig must have wielded a pen that ignites to write this story down with so much boldness, creativity, and awareness that no one could ever imagine for an already perfect plastic to deserve.It wasn't a surprise Margot Robbie could kill this role and make us all believe she was born for this because she was. She is my favorite actress after all. She led the film as perfectly as her Barbie but it was Ryan Gosling that took me by surprise with how much he embodied kenergy that came so explosive like some atomic bomb designed by some civilian scientist (pun intended). Then there's America Ferrera (watch our for the scenes that earned her the ""heart of the film"" ribbon) and the scene Billie Eilish's ""What Was I Made For"" was made for. (If I were to predict with all confidence who's bagging an Oscar nomination? It's Billie for Original Song.)Barbie indeed subverted expectations and stereotypes. And I hate that it worked, that's why I loved it.20 out of 121 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8,Barbie
"Barbie (2023) is a movie that my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows Barbie in a perfect world who believes she is the perfect role model for little girls in the real world. When things start feeling off for her in her world, she discovers she may need to go to the real world to set things right. When she gets to the real world, she discovers how wrong she was about being the perfect role model.This movie is directed by Greta Gerwig (Little Women) and stars Margot Robbie (Suicide Squad), Issa Rae (Insecure), Kathryn McKinnon (Bombshell), Ryan Gosling (The Notebook), Alexandra Shipp (X-Men: Apocalypse) and Will Ferrell (Elf).This movie had a lot more going for it than I anticipated. The universe and characters are very well developed, thoroughly put together with the history of the Barbie universe incorporated and a smart scripts. The dialogue and interactions were much deeper than I anticipated. There were a lot of good messages and lessons baked into the storyline. My only complaint was how much focus there was on the ""Ken's."" He was a worthwhile villain, but the ending dance scene and finding self moment was overdone; however, everything about the Barbie plot hit the nail on the head.Overall, this is better and deeper than I expected and was definitely worth a watch. I would score this a 7 and strongly recommend it.15 out of 68 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7,Barbie
"This movie was an aesthetic dream . Just looking at it was a treat . Scene to scene , color schemes , outfit choices . This kept you drawn in and you wanted to keep looking - even if you didn't like anything else - the straight up visual was worth it .The satire and political commentary was absolutely on point . This movie didn't try to hide what it was or what it was doing - it showed you trailer to finish and I loved that . There was nothing put in by accident - everything was thoughtful and served a purpose . This was true for every joke , every clothing choice , every character , every emotion ,The humor was funny - but this was my one complaint . I don't like crude humor and I am a prude and honestly some of it was crass . Nothing ""bad"" and I recognize I am a grinch in that way - I laughed but this was the reason I would not watch it over and over , just don't value that type of joke . But I recognize and respect the writing and it was very important to the movie .The casting and acting - INCREDIBLE! I mean really - every single person was better than the next . Margot Robbie was absolutely incredible . Every single supporting cast member was so well casted and acted . America Ferrara was amazing and her monologue was probably the highlight of the film and the most powerful part - every woman ( every person ) can relate in some way if not all ways .Hats off to Greta for this film - she took and assignment and got an A+ and then earned some extra credit - one of the great directors .Great film - and I respect it so much as a film - doesn't mean I have to love watching it ( that's what for me makes it an 8 instead of a 10, but honestly it probably deserves an 11)IGo see it - it's absolutely worth it.5 out of 24 found this helpful.

"I didn't know how many points to give it but I give it a 10 because I have no negatives, I went to watch this movie at the premiere and it was great. The actors did a great job wow! The outfits were also on point. And the easter eggs to Barbies that they were no longer allowed to make was also fun. And the Barbies in the real world was kinda fun how they did was really well done.

"My husband asked me to compare this to something else to ally, and my first thought was Elf. In these ways it lives up to one of the greatest movies of all time - both are hilarious, have wonderful musical numbers, heartwarming, will make you tear up, complicated parental storylines, unlikely character bonding, and whimsical visual tie-ins/world-building + bonus of both having Will Ferrel to boot.I loved the soundtrack - the Lizzo song being a fun 4th wallesque/narrator-y way to introduce Barbieland.The pace was even - I never felt it was moving too quickly or wanting a scene to wrap up.Some more unexpected show-stealers were Simu Liu and Arianna Greenblatt.The haters are simply mad this is a film that is self-aware and for a new generation.9 out of 37 found this helpful.

"On the plus side, this was an ambitious, dazzling film with what I felt was an original concept. It explored the world of gender stereotyping and male-female relationships, using the world of Barbie and Ken as its base point. There was a strong feminist theme running through it, but I did not find this overwhelming. Whilst the male figures were often portrayed as stupid and one-dimensional, this was done with some wit and indeed affection.The action migrated between the real world and the mythical world of Barbie, and so perhaps it was no surprise that the plot tended to meander and remained unconvincing. The energy of the film was sustained by the comedy and the zaniness of the characters.I differ from some critics in that I thought the best performance came from Margot Robbie as Barbie. Her character bounced between parody and realism but she managed the demands well. I thought that the much acclaimed Ryan Gosling tended to over-act and his character became annoying.This may be down to my age and my Englishness, but I was unable to make out the detail of the many snappy one-liners that were delivered. The young and the American will probably not have this trouble.Though likeable and even moving in places, altogether this film felt like less than the sum of its parts. Its attempts at juggling comedy and serious themes, fantasy and reality, were not ultimately successful and it became incoherent and lacking in some kind of unity.Ultimately, for me, the acid test of a film is the issue of whether or when I start wanting it to end. I made to about two-thirds of the way through.3 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6,Barbie
I love this film. It's so what we need right now. A bright and happy movie that makes you smile.The way people have embraced it is amazing. People dressing up to go and see it. It's so cleverly done. Margo Robbie is stunning and brilliant as Barbie. Ryan Gosling was the right pick for Ken. He has that cheeky charm and vulnerability down to a tee. He is such a great performer and dancer. If you ever had a Barbie this will bring back memories. It's got it's political undertones and it's trying to get a message across. But it's a film I think will be doing the rounds for a long time with the likes of Mamma Mia.5 out of 23 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink,8,Barbie
"I am not surprised in the least that the Barbie movie is trash and a truly deplorable career choice by Margot Robbie who will probably be type cast forever in Barbie-type roles.To begin with, there is just too much pink and superficiality for this movie to inspire anything more than groans and watching your watch waiting for the whole travesty to be over. The plot is completely by the numbers as Barbie has the perfect life in Barbie World. Then suddenly she yearns to see the ""real world."" Where did we see that storyline before? Let's see... I know... The Little Mermaid and a hundred other movies ripping off the same plot.But if that's not bad enough, we have to sit through dreary dialogue such as Ken wanting to sleep over with Barbie while being totally innocent of sex and the fairy god mother pressuring Barbie to reject the high heels in order to seek enlightenment, as if Barbie should not make the choice on her own without somebody prodding her in a particular direction.Even the people who like it can't point to anything original in it. Where that 77% comes from is beyond me.73 out of 117 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",2,Barbie
"Ryan Gosling as Ken I loved too much, but Margot Robbie as Barbie is perfect.I understood the message very well, it's great to see how they destroy little by little the stereotypes of a ""pretty"" person and replace it with the reality that many human beings live. And after all, men and women (and every living being) deserve to be happy.One of the scenes I loved, aside from the opening reference, is the ""Just Ken Exclusive"" scene. I would have loved to see more of Ken!!!! And don't forget that you can be whatever you want to be.By the way, I absolutely hated the advertising to a certain car brand.12 out of 73 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Didn't really know what to expect from this, but this is one of the best films of the year. Laugh-out-loud funny and heartfelt, Margot and Ryan Gosling throw themselves head first into Barbie and Ken like some kind of Zoolander/Legally Blonde/Lego Movie hybrid, but far more intelligently written.Jam packed with in-jokes, sly references and even a Mattel-censored F-bomb, Barbie is relentlessly entertaining from start to finish. Most of the satire will fly over kids' heads, as we had a theatre-full of Belgrave's finest letting their vile offspring literally run riot under the screen.Luckily, the movie was so good we kept our teacher voices to ourselves. Over to Oppenheimer on Sunday. 9.10 out of 69 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9,Barbie
"BARBIEHEIMER is among us! Between BARBIE and OPPENHEIMER releasing on the same week, the wife really wanted to see this first and I obliged.BARBIE is definitely bound to have some divisiveness due to its ""feminism"" - and yes a lot of feminism (honestly what did you expect). Not addressing this is like not addressing the nuclear bomb in OPPENHEIMER. For a movie about a children's toy, I got to give it some kudos for its subversion and tying to put out a message this big. I'm not shocked that the film focused a bit more on the reality elements of the real world as opposed to the fantasy side. A lot of that is because this is a Greta Gerwig film (co-written with her partner Noah Baumbach) and she is one of the best working director/writer today.The unconventional approach is something to admire. The film swings with these metaphysical ideas and existential crisis. The performances from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling carry the film. Robbie tackles the role very well. The story asks her to do a lot, and Robbie showcases Barbie's awakening with sincerity, terror, confusion, naivety, humor and bittersweet acceptance. Gosling gets to cut loose and be funny. He goes on his own journey to discovering who he is so there's layers to his Ken as well. He also has a funny rivalry/banter with Simu Liu's Ken.Rest of the supporting cast are a bit underdeveloped, but they get moments to shine here and there and serve the plot in motion. Some highlights are Kingsley Ben-Adir, Issa Rae, Michael Cera and Kate McKinnon.America Ferrara and Ariana Greenblatt are the human mother/daughter duo in the film. Ferrara's character delivers a monolog that is very on the nose and at that point you're with it or meh about it. For me personally, I honestly don't mind it as long as its entertaining, and to the film's credit it was, for at least the first act of the film. It's at its best with the self aware meta humor, but eventually the film gets too carried away and takes itself too seriously, loosing its humor and leaving us experiencing moments that are a bit of a chore to sit through.One could say it was refreshing to watch an incredibly self aware film that isn't afraid to be bold in its message, but for me, while I agree with the underlying message it's very heavy handed and preachy. I connected more when the film explored the nature of Barbie's character. There's one scene that tackles Barbie's legacy directly that raised the existential crisis for her, but it isn't revisited in favor of telling a bigger societal story.Production design, the sets and visuals are very well done. Shoutout to production designer Sarah Greenwood and set decorators Katie Spencer. I feel like Barbie could take home the Oscar for production design. When you're in Barbie Land, the overall usage of pink and the plastic feel makes the whole experience feel immersive. Cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto makes the film feel like you're there. It has a vibrant and inviting energy that you can't help but gaze at.I am curious how some families who saw the film feel about it as some might have expected a more straight forward approach, as opposed to this more nuanced subversive take, but I think overall the film is destined to be enjoyed overall and successful. It just might get a sequel if it can rake in the money, which it looks like it will.As a male, this film isn't made for me. I'm obviously not the target audience for it. However, the film did enough to make me feel engaged where I laughed at some jokes, but the second half is where I felt the film was talking at me instead of engaging me as a viewer. It flirts with being a unique fantasy/real world introspective story, but then seems to be more interested in making a point by the end of it.6.4 out of 11 found this helpful.

"I expected a funny, easy-going movie that you can watch while scrolling on your phone. I was amazed by the depth of the story. Feminism done right, without the overly woke culture that is cringey and contraproductive in most cases. A must see if you're capable of seeing beyond the pitch perfect pink world. :) Wasn't sure about Ryan Gosling as Ken, the match seemed off, but after seeing the movie I think he did great. Helen Mirren is the narrator which is also amazing. Beautiful story abour equality, feminism, finding your role in the world and also about the importance of finding yourself in the big world.54 out of 177 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Barbie is a film that revolves around fun and enjoyment. The story centers on our titular character, Barbie, in her world full of pink, numerous other Barbies and Kens, unique rules, and a repetitive daily routine. The movie overflows with laughter, clever remarks, musical numbers, dazzling sets, existential crises, and much more.Margot Robbie, portraying Barbie, and Ryan Gosling, playing Ken, thoroughly embodied their roles to the fullest. As the main character in her world, Barbie is admired by everyone and sought after for attention. She must adhere to the ""Stereotypical Barbie"" image with flawless perfection, which can become exhausting over time. On the other hand, Ken serves as the placeholder character for the public, and with his dry humor, he delivers the majority of laughs throughout the film, showcasing his unwavering adoration for Barbie.Director Greta Gerwig, known for her unique storytelling, showcases her creativity once again in Barbie. The dialogue is woven in a way that allows for multiple interpretations, enabling Barbie to discuss her own world and even extend beyond it. The movie transcends the boundaries of a typical comedy at times and addresses issues that resonate in our own world.The bold choice of including a reference to '2001: A Space Odyssey' before the actual start sets an enthralling mood. The film initially feels like an episode from the Twilight Zone, with the repeating day trope, but gradually reveals something amiss. These daring choices elevate Barbie from being just another comedy movie to a film with a deliberate vision.Barbie slightly teeters on the edge of delivering patriarchal messages, especially towards the end, but it manages to steer clear of crossing the line. As one of the original feminist icons since her creation in 1959, certain types of comments were inevitable. The movie addresses these issues with eloquence, all while remembering its primary purpose is to entertain and offer an escape to a fictional world.The marketing strategy for Barbie is nothing short of brilliant. Pairing it with Oppenheimer, a drastically different film, for a double feature is a stroke of genius. Viewers have the choice to immerse themselves first in the bubbly and joyful world of Barbie, followed by the thought-provoking story of Oppenheimer. The success of this marketing approach is evident in the box office results, as many attendees opted for both screenings, turning it into a global film festival with two back-to-back films.The production design, as showcased in the dazzling trailers, is impeccable, packed with intricate details, easter eggs, various era Barbies and Kens, and more. The commitment put into curating these elements from different years and presenting them in an engaging manner is commendable.Barbie arrives at an interesting time, with both writers and actors on strike, and Hollywood on the verge of temporary closure. However, the combination of Barbie and Oppenheimer offers audiences a choice and a break from the usual superhero or unnecessary sequel movies. Barbie delivers abundant laughter, lively music, outstanding performances, and takes viewers on an immensely enjoyable journey.1 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Barbie, the doll that destroyed stereotypes and taboos to later generate new ones and destroy them again, arrives at the cinema for the first time and does so masterfully. ""Barbie"" is a film that portrays misogyny from the perspective of the famous doll, the script is a biting criticism of patriarchy, internal problems within feminism, family and social relationships, consumerism and existentialism, all full of humor, in some scenes with a lot of black humor and the result is excellent, capturing what it wants to convey to the public. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is magnificent and together with the production design they bring a fictional country full of fantastic and pink plastics. The soundtrack is tremendous, with a list of songs wisely chosen (with some exceptions). The cast is tremendous, Margot Robbie's performance is realistic and sentimental, proving to be the perfect Barbie in all aspects. Ryan Gosling plays Ken with humor and also gives him perfect dramatic nuances. America Ferrara as a working mother achieves a performance to remember, especially for her powerful monologue. Kate McKinnon gives a highly comic performance and an endearing character of a very unusual Barbie. Rhea Perlman pulls off an incredible performance wittily balancing comedy and drama. Ann Roth in a special participation of a single dialogue and a smile achieved a sublime and unforgettable performance. Helen Mirren with a voice acting as The Narrator describes everything with feeling and passion taking advantage of her imposing voice. Greta Gerwig's work as a director is genius, she manages to capture the ideas of the script, gives it her own style and pays homage to movie classics. ""Barbie"" is the movie event of the year, a rightfully earned title for this current classic.4 out of 25 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Barbie turned out to be a bit of a letdown. I had high hopes for the movie, but it didn't quite meet my expectations. The story felt forced, and the narrative lacked a decisive direction. There were moments of humor, but it missed the opportunity to be hilariously entertaining. The film could have been much better if they had taken advantage of the potential for creative and imaginative storytelling that the Barbie franchise offers. Despite the visually appealing scenes, the overall execution left me feeling unsatisfied. I hoped for a more captivating and memorable experience, but unfortunately, it fell short of delivering that. It is good entertainment.10 out of 15 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6,Barbie
"Barbie was hilarious, emotional and exciting. I LOVED the wardrobe and props - very colorful and exact replicas of what I played with in the 90s. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with this movie - casting was perfect. I especially loved the humor and emotional grasp this movie had on the audience in the movie theatre. This is definitely a feel good movie and I hope they continue the franchise. I have to note that this movie had twists and turns at every corner, in good way! There is a lot of action, dancing and surprise ha ha moments. This is perfect for families and adults really; go see it!12 out of 64 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Barbie (2023) : Movie Review -Barbie Review: Greta Gerwig's Barbie movie is a breezy, funny, pinky, and girly Ride Into Barbieland. These four soft adjectives are enough to describe the Barbie movie. Greta Gerwig takes us into Barbie land with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling to deliver a possible fantasy that we all dreamed of as children or as adults. Being a boy, I couldn't have a Barbie doll in my childhood, but I did have a close look at her with my female cousins playing with her, doing make-up, dress-up, and all the girly stuff. And I don't think any boy is unaware of Barbie and Ken, even if he hasn't played with them in childhood. It's a fascination for us and a dream come true for girls. I am not at all hesitant to admit that if I were a girl, I would have enjoyed this movie more than I actually did as a boy. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it, and that's more than enough for today's social media gender ego system.Barbie begins with the inception of Barbie and how she appeared on earth (if we call it that in this fantasy movie). This very scene is a lot of fun when you see Margot Robbie appearing in black and white checks in one piece and little girls breaking their dolls into pieces. Soon, we are transported into Barbie Land, where all Barbies are living happily. All the women are self-confident, working in top positions, successful, and enjoying life to the fullest, while all Kens are jobless and do nothing but try to mingle with barbies. Our stereotypical Barbie (Robbie) suddenly begins to dysfunction and sense the morality of human life. She has to travel to the human world to find out who the child is who is calling her to be there. Obviously, Ken (Gosling) forces his company on her. However, things go wrong for Barbie in the real world, where she realises she is not loved anymore, whereas Ken finds a motto of patriarchy. Ken returns and takes over Barbieland by persuading other Kens and brainwashing the rest of the babies there. Here, distraught Barbie finds Gloria (America Ferrera), a Mattel employee, who is the catalyst of her existential crisis. Gloria began playing with her daughter Sasha's (Ariana Greenblatt) Barbie toys while experiencing her own identity crisis, inadvertently transferring her concerns to Stereotypical Barbie. Gloria restores Barbie, and then they take off on a mission to bring back all Barbies.It's been a while since we have seen a good-budget comedy movie, so Barbie certainly ends the dry spell. I mean, this one is a fun ride from start to end. It may be a little childish-oh, that's a bad word-let's say child-friendly, but it's damn funny. The humour is girlish, yes, but I liked it too. From Zack Snyder, The Godfather, cautionary note on Margot's casting to slapstick one-liners, Barbie is such a colourful comedy. It does not look like an intelligent film; rather, it stages itself as a crazy comedy. That's one of the points I'd say went wrong in the climax. These characters aren't supposed to be smart, but they intend to be when it comes to ending the show. Why? Pixar's Toy Story had the simple but subtle philosophy that a toy should be a toy for a lifetime. It may have many owners, but its job is to stick to them and be loyal, because that's why we humans love them. Barbie challenges this universally accepted theory and goes against the tide. Now, whether it's good or bad, I leave that choice to you since my personal opinion isn't very affirmative about this theory.Barbie was meant to be a career-defining role for Margot Robbie, and she made sure that you'd remember her forever as Barbie. I kept looking for a single frame where she would not look pretty, and I couldn't find it for 110 minutes. I melted, man. Ryan Gosling's Ken is the funniest character in the whole movie. That cute flirting, those reluctant expressions, jealousy, arrogance, and at last self-discovery-this man has lived the character. Kate McKinnon's weird Barbie appears for a short time but serves enough. Other babies, including Issa Rae, Hari Nef, Alexandra Shipp, Emma Mackay, Dua Lipa, Sharon Rooney, Ana Cruz Kayne, Ritu Arya, and Nicola Coughlan, are all gorgeous. On the other hand, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Scott Evans, Simu Liu, Rob Brydon, Ncuti Gatwa, and John Cena as Kens add fine support. Michael Cera, Ariana Greenblatt, and Will Ferrell pass the time well, while Rhea Perlman's cameo is blasting. The biggest cheer in the Barbie movie came for America Ferrera's monologue, which describes the struggle and victory of feminism. Ariana Greenblatt steals the show in the first, and the rest of the cast has done well.Made on a budget of $145 million, Barbie is a lavish big screen entertainer, as the production design makes sure you feel the fantasy right. Those fakish items could have been excluded, but having them there is kind of fun in itself. Who's to blame? Rodrigo Prieto's camera does the talking with close-ups and long shots of Barbie and Ken. Barbie does not have any loo breaks, courtesy of Nick Houy's superb editing, and the music is lovable. Some people often say that a female director and female lead's pair is something else, and I have to accept that Barbie could have been a lot less underwhelming without Greta Gerwig. This woman has made a world that is so adorable and so rummy. A few flaws are there in the script and the characters, but since we are not discussing an artistic masterpiece of cinema, let's Chuck that discussion. Let's enjoy this pinky and girly entertainer, which is sure to take female audiences by storm and leave a good enough impact on men too. Not to forget, who's writing it.RATING - 6*10 out of 47 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6,Barbie
"I have never been a fan of Barbie: I found her too pink, too clichéd - until I watched this film. As the trailer suggested, this movie is for people who hate the legendary doll, so I gave it a shot. It was worth it: I seldom had that much fun in cinema.Barbie lives her happy life in Barbieland, but as she develops a human consciousness, she has to travel to the real world in order to restore normality.This movie is so much more than just funny, as it is political and not predictable. It discusses the influence of the doll on young girls: It criticizes Barbie's stereotypical body while acknowledging her for revolutionizing the way girls saw themselves.""Because Barbie can be anything, girls can be anything"" is said throughout the film. As Barbie taught girls to be more than just mothers, this is true.Margot Robbie has proved what a great actress she is. That makes her the perfect cast for Barbie, as you take her seriously and sympathize with her. Ryan Gosling as her counterpart is equally fitting. He provides the film with a great sense of humor that will leave you laughing out loud.All in all, ""Barbie"" differs from the majority of movies that are produced in Hollywood right now, as it is refreshingly new, funny and surprising. Director and author Greta Gerwig has done a great job creating this hilarious summer movie.18 out of 96 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9,Barbie
"A fantastic satirical drama on patriarchy blended with witty humor, fabulous direction, and fabulous acting.It can be many things, but not a kids' film or gender-specific film.Greta takes us into fantasy barbieland with the deep concepts of consumerism, patriarcy, physical insecurity, and self-discovery cleverly layered under it.Conveys all these in a satirical and humorous way subtly and beautifully.I loved how it shows both extremes of patriarchy of men and also women.The sets, visuals, music, and costumes were just so amazing sets the whole vibe.Ken and Barbie had such awesome chemistry and genreated great humor on the screen.I was so excited to see margot robbie & emma mackey together in the film. And they were fantastic. All the others were beautiful, both in looks and acting.There are some really good one-liner and monologues which are funny & make you think at the same time.I felt good hearing about the response for Barbie, considering the talk around baribie being a silly film for only kids or gender s0ecific. But it's much more than that.So, indians, after watching the hyped up oppenheimer, watch Barbie too, and you won't be disappointed.15 out of 38 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Having just watched a woman drag her tween daughter out of the movie, trailed along a bit after by a couple of older sorts, I can tell you this movie is not what some people have envisioned.It is not a light-hearted children's film. It is PG-13 for a reason and also if you haven't taught your daughter the word ""patriarchy"" yet, that might be something to cover first.Second, it's not a paean to the Barbie doll, Barbie collectors, or Mattel as a corporation. Honestly, I'm not sure how they're signed on as producers except perhaps to prove the point that the corporation is all about a cash grab.(The execs come across as buffoons and their talking points about being there for little girls are definitely shredded in the early encounters. No room to come back.)So while many went into the theater this weekend expecting a fun movie, not everyone will enjoy the show.---I personally thought it was ok--not as grand as expected, but I got to the end well enough.The acting was the fun part, especially Ryan Gosling as the air headed and thwarted Ken--voice of male fragility.Songs are catchy ear worms. The sets are marvelous pop art pink and scaled to make things look doll-like.The plot is a weak point, I'll admit, being very simplistic.Honestly, however, I kind of expected that. (So unlike the women above neither stomped nor snuck out.)Mainly the message is to crush the patriarchy (ok--but where is Allan's role in this patriarchy and why is a pregnant Midge so looked down on, even now?And since the ending sees Mattel theoretically still ramping production, what did we actually learn from this messaging anyhow?)If the pitch was to be a pivot to a modernized Barbie, I'm not sure that marketing campaign did any favors. And if it was that humanism is more important than corporate greed, the associated marketing merch kind of undercut the message, too.At any rate, the directoral easter eggs kept me going through all of it (call back cinematic opening is just the start) So there's good news and bad news, and maybe it's cost sunk fallacy making me give the film a seven. But I thought it was ""OK,"" so here we are.3 out of 8 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7,Barbie
"I have successfully completed Barbenheimer and what a wonderful weekend for cinema it was. Every so often is their polar opposite releases but none ever this big. I saw packed theatres consistently on both days which was an amazing thing to be apart of. It felt very much like the old days of going to the theatres for any movie and the auditorium being absolutely packed!Barbie follows stereotypical Barbie as her normal perfect life gets disturbed by something happening in the real world as to which she has to leave Barbie world and fix her life.This is the bare bones of the story but Greta Gerwig explores so much more than that. It's obvious the film is highly inspired by films such as Wizard of Oz, La La Land and 2001 space odyssey to name a few. The talent behind the camera is very obvious and this is extremely stylized film. All of the Barbie stuff is top notch and the sets they built feels like something Tim Burton cooked up. Really excellent set design, costumes and props throughout this film.I was really worried that this film would spend too much time in the real world and it doesn't. It focuses alot of its story in Barbie World which I really appreciated. Margot Robbie is perfect in the role and continues to showcase her acting chops. Ryan Gosling is amazing too he has the perfect comedic timing and delivery. Perfect casting combo for this role.Barbie is a much deeper character exploration and interesting topic point that is very aesthetically shown in this film. No matter what you believe in there is an honest message and I'm sure many girls of all ages will relate to this film on one level or another.4 out of 12 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I guess my starting point was not a huge fan of anything Barbie, but to be honest I went in moderately openminded. The film was dull at times and at others quite subversive!Some great humour some odd moments, felt a little stilted but that was clearly the intent of the film makers.I sat through it feeling at the end mildly perplexed and unsure if I enjoyed it or not.I felt it was at times quite clever but still a bit confusing much of the time.As a 67 year old I may not be the best judge nor did the chatting 7-8 year old two seats away from me add much to the experience.Go see and make your mind up, overall I much preferred Oppenheimer.4 out of 7 found this helpful.

"I went to see this one with my 11 year old daughter, thinking that it would be a movie directed to kids. It's not! Actually, it's one of the best social satires I have seen and many jokes and references will be difficult or even impossible to understand for kids. They'll still be having a good time, but it's the adults that are actually in for the big treat. I absolutely loved it and recommend this to everyone who loves a clever satire with a lot of heart and mesmerizing cinematography.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are perfect in their roles, the script/story is engaging, funny but also very touching at times and the overall result is delightful.You'll find yourself wanting to own this one in your collection, it really is that good.13 out of 62 found this helpful.

"LIKES:The Setting: -It feels like a Barbie world in real life and captures the energy of the doll in all glory.-Plenty of accessories, the plastic feeling, and the toy like atmosphere with real life people is totally captured and super fun.-The real world is fine and does the job of acting as the second world, but it's really Barbie land that excels in the feeling of Mattel bringing it to life.The Plot's Originality: -Yes, much of it is predictable and familiar, but there is more to it than meets the eye -Barbie's plot is one part comedy, one part discovery, and one part political philosophy that sort of gives you a variety I wasn't expecting.-It may feel a little out there, but points for trying to be different and more advanced than many other stories have attempted.The Acting: -McKinnon may have been used too much, but I loved her in this film for the way her weirdness works for weird Barbie. Quirky, fun, a little bold, but that SNL line delivery that really works for delivering lines.-Rae is fine for when she is on screen. She's got a few dynamics that her monotone delivery works with what you got, but to get top bill/first bill doesn't make sense to me -Ryan Gosling works well int eh roles, and for his direction, a supporting actor role nomination feels good for me. He's clumsy, funny, hardcore silly, and it works for the ridiculous nature and tone of the movie.-And for Margot Robbie, the woman continues to knock the ball out of the park for how amazing she fits the role. She's sparkly, quirky, but has a range that she just brings. Gerwig brought some new elements out in terms of representation thought maybe not the Oscar performance like some call for.The Comedy At Times: -The movie does have general jokes that worked very well for me, well timed moments that were perfect for breaking the moment.-Satire, to a point, was amazing at times at how much fun they had with certain concepts. The design of Barbie dolls that failed, or the fact of fashion drawing eyes, and even certain trends that we love. It was clever, balanced, and had this timing delivery that worked.-Some of the Ken lines were funny, the fact that I was like classic Patrick from SpongeBob was very fun, especially when sometimes paired with one of the other style of jokes.-And Helen Mirren's narration was the funniest component for me. Her dry delivery, the classy sass, and the fact the woman just sells the lines was my favorite part in terms of laughs and wished there had been more.-As such, the comedy did work at times for me.The Pace: -It's two hours long, but for the most part doesn't feel it and that goes to the fun pacing.-Barbie starts out fun, exciting, and pops into the adventure with a lot of energy.-Then that energy sort of stays, but hunkers down a bit, never losing the whimsy, but finding a means to feel entertaining and somewhat engaging.-That is the superior quality of this movie compared to the other big one, that engaging pace and just having fun.The Music: -By far, the music is what works the best for me in this movie and tells so much and brings so much energy in the track list.-The songs from the radio and the past work well, comedic devices that were quite honestly some of the best jokes for me with several of the characters.-Other songs are fun musical numbers that work, dance numbers full of pop vibe, or later a true stage show musical that had the theatrics and jazz of a stage show.-As for the new songs that were made for the movie, they were my favorite. Remixes of Barbie girl, an exposition song and reprise, and a few other numbers just have so much character that it really added points for me in terms of just how much fun Barbie can be.The Message: -There is a very deep message to this movie, and to be honest... I did enjoy this part of Gerwig's writing.-It's deep, has character development and really drives home a lot of social commentary and trends under the microscope about human qualities. I liked how it was built in, and the dialog to embrace it, and just wished this movie had kept that in line with me.DISLIKES:The Fun Vibes Take a Detour: -I just said the pace was good and there was an energy, but... the fun part did take a detour the further you went into the film.-Gerwig is a very ""unique"" writer and once she got her hooks into her political writing, there were times where the first part of the film's fun was lost to very agenda heavy writing.-I t felt a bit forced for me, and I longed for more numbers, a little adventure, and a little less banter/beating the dead horse that the film went.-Throw in the darker aspects of the agenda, and losing that fun at the beginning was not what I would have liked to see for most of the movie.Gerwig's Hyper Agenda -I get this is who she is, but I've seen movies where that side of her is toned down and we get a much deeper character drama.-But Barbie... Barbie pulls no punches and berates you with very in your face, no holds bar, rather excessive and in some cases insulting humor that I got tired of.-There were times where that line was perfect and the story quality maximized, but most of the movie failed that balance and she did not seem sorry for what I felt was a tad too toxic for my liking.-If you are a fan of this type of hyper writing, then you are in great shape, but for those like me who are tired of movies becoming agenda venting, this movie is going to lose points for being annoying and simplistic and losing the creative spark.The Stupidity: -The movie has a smart writer and so seeing so much ridiculous silliness in one movie to contradict the smart writing didn't accomplish much for me.-Will Ferrell's direction was one of these moments where he was a straight up idiot, saying weird things that were more awkward and uncomfortable than funny for me. His little montage was just really dumb and to the point it stuck out a bit too much.-Meanwhile, Ken's handling was fine being a moron, but Gerwig's political writing sort of didn't do much for me as rather than improving and becoming elevated like his counterpart, sort of grew toxic level stupid.-That excessiveness again just doesn't work when I saw those sparkling moments that show where everything comes together, instead of feeling like an adult version of a Disney Channel Original movie.The Character Usage is odd: -The movie is trying to balance a lot of names and characters and it only works on that half of the time.-Barbie has too many characters, and some of the people I expected to have more time, were limited than I anticipated and quite honestly a political tool.-They do their work, but, it's just missing balance and full use and I think it's relying too much on a sequel and people just happy with being comedic props and line spewers than anything else.The Story Is All Over The Place: -My fellow reviewers are right, it's a weird story and it is all over the place.-This might give it the unique twist, but Barbie's tale is a jumble of lots of different feels and theatrics that sort of work together, but feel messily put together.-One level is like I said fun, bright, and feels like a dance party meets on stage musical that works to an extent.-The second then becomes this dive into the psyche mixed with somehow comedically stupid gimmicks to try and keep entertaining going -Third then goes metaphysical and really deep, and it kind of works, but then goes really odd and sort of trippy, to a way I'm still trying to process.-Gerwig's writing is always deeper and more complex, but this might have tried to be a bit too ambitious for its own good for me and felt just so scrambled and very much in your face for plot telling.The VERDICT: Barbie is a venue that I really did have some fun with and was surprised by the unexpected things it had to offer and the clever writing I had hoped would shine in. A geek like me knowing the references, appreciating the pokes to it, and the fun timing of some well-written lines that had me laughing in the theater. I loved the acting, loved the set, and just loved a lot of the vibes of the less agenda writing really worked for me and will appeal to many of the general group. And the music, whew, really loved it and the energy and storytelling it did which was very good for me. But the movie did not appeal to me in that Gerwig seemed to reach too high for being unique and ""elevated"" leading to moments that just don't appeal to a reviewer like me. The detour of fun for very politically heavy writing was probably my least favorite aspect, losing the killer vibes and balanced fun and humor with a very polarized way of thinking was not my cup of tea. In addition the story elements and character usage felt a bit jumbled, scrambled, shallow, and having too many character moments to really show off Gerwig's better writing. Thus, when balancing this out, my score for this movie is that it's a theater worthy film for a lot of groups and dates. The score is:Adventure/Comedy/Fantasy: 7.5-8.0 Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0.9 out of 41 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7,Barbie

"I am so torn, on this movie. There is no doubt, that Barbie is beautifully made movie, with an awesome cast and an amazing creative team. Margo Robbie was born to play Barbie and lets be honest Ryan Gosling stole the entire movie. Then again I can't think of a single cast Member I didn't like. The references are amazing, as a boy with a sister, I grew with Barbie so I recognised a lot things. But, I did not care for the writing and some of the movies messages, were not just bad, but problematic. I was going to go into details about all the things that bothered me, but I'm not spoiling anything. I don't hate this movie, by any means, but I don't love it either. I think the target audience will love it, and lets be honest thats not me.13 out of 27 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6,Barbie
"Honestly, not too sure what my partner and I were expecting, but we figured it would be a fun, empowering, and sweet movie.Instead, we got a preachy, confused, mess that oscillated between comedy and social commentary in a wildly jarring way.Unfortunately, I think the writers took the opportunity to project their feelings onto the audience. The message seems dated and naive. At best it's a bit of an eye roll, at worst it's an attempt to shame young girls into a self defeating thought process.Acting, sound track, set design, and some bits of comedy were really good, and there is some genuine cinema in there.13 out of 15 found this helpful.

"Prepare to embark on a mesmerizing journey through the enchanting world of Barbie! This handcrafted ball of serotonin is an absolute delight, leaving your heart brimming with joy from start to finish. Trust me, my cheeks were hurting too, but it was a small price to pay for the unbridled happiness that ensued.In the magical realm of Barbieland, Oscar-worthy set designs work like portals, whisking you away to a realm of imagination and wonder. The chemistry between Margot and Ryan is nothing short of spectacular, radiating an irresistible charm that leaps off the screen and captures your heart.Beyond the surface, the film's plot weaves a tapestry of surprises, defying predictability with cunning twists that keep you guessing throughout. Amid the laughter, ""Barbie"" serves as a brilliant mirror, reflecting upon society's norms, dismantling stereotypes, and fearlessly confronting issues of gender inequality and toxic masculinity. Such clever social commentary adds depth and meaning to this seemingly carefree adventure.As for the comedy, prepare for a sidesplitting experience! Joke after joke lands perfectly, leaving you in stitches and gasping for breath. However, the true comedic gem is none other than Will Ferrel, who delivers a performance that leaves a lasting impression. With impeccable timing and wit, he steals the spotlight in every scene, creating comedic gold that will resonate with audiences of all ages.While the movie does wear the hat of a toy advertisement, it walks the tightrope adeptly. Balancing appeal to the younger audience with engaging entertainment for adults, ""Barbie"" strikes a perfect harmony that caters to both ends of the spectrum.With all the praise deservedly sung, there is only one minor drawback - the movie ends too soon! As the credits roll, you'll find yourself yearning for more of this delightful and captivating experience, a testament to the film's greatness.14 out of 74 found this helpful.

"This was a great movie for the type that it is. Yes, is cheeky / cheesy/ over the top. It's also heart warming, fun, and really original. I loved the way that the movie hit the nail on the head about the complexity of being female, young or old. It truly was a reflection of how so many of us have been made to feel. They also got some laughs over play on words or specific movements made by the actors and actresses because it was just so real and true to the way we all played as children. The casting of MR as Barbie and RG as Ken were such perfect choices. The kids liked it and so did us 30 somethings. Perfect balance of nostalgia and today. Highly recommend it.21 out of 95 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"First off, I'm a 60 year-old white male and this movie wasn't even made for me.If your at all interested, then go see this movie. It's funny. It has a lot of funny lines and scenes.The recreation of the set is incredible, but maybe a little vidual indigestion. You adapt quickly.The characters are really good. Perfect for what they are expected to be. Both the main Barbie and Ken are excellently portrayed.There is a feminist overtone, but there is no lack of irony and mockery of both sexes. No one is asking you to be moved or to change your political or other persuasion. Just relax and enjoy it as a comedy.The people who criticize this movie for political or macho reasons are way out of bounds and are too easily swayed by today's political environment. This move is a funny comedy that might actually open your eyes to a feminist point of view of you choose to absorb it. If not, you'll still laugh and call it a good time.3 out of 7 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7,Barbie
"4.5 out of 5 stars.Barbie is a pretty good fantasy comedy film that delivers all expectations with a film being based on a beloved doll and toy brand. It is fun. It is dumb in a fun way that adults and children will love which has a story with a theme. Humor and fun characters.Margot Robbie delivers as Barbie. And along with Ryan Gosling as Ken. And rest of the cast ensemble had fun with there roles. Its a story about Barbie played by Margot Robbie who decides to leave barbieland after she has been feeling different about herself. While coming into the real world with Ken. To find out who has been playing with her doll version.Humor is a lot of fun that is entertaining in about every scene. The music soundtrack is awesome. The flashy visuals can be cheesy and knows how to be fun and not taken seriously.Overall, it is one fun summer film that everyone will enjoy.2 out of 11 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I went to see this movie without even seeing the trailer first. I'm a 42 yo man and people kept posting stuff about this movie on social media, so when a friend asked me to go watch it, I said yes...I was expecting some kind of dumb movie, but this is not. It appeals to teenagers but also to an older audience. I loved the sense of humor, Mattel was sometimes laughing at themselves too. I found that very nicely done. The acting is amazing. However I liked the first part of the movie more than the second one. It starts to analyze the patriarchy a bit too heavily for my taste. They want to make it clear that this is a feminist movie. They want to clear Barbie's image of the stereotypes she's been associated with for decades: she's not a blonde and skinny perfect bimbo girl. Barbie is a feminist, she represents empowered women. I keep questioning myself about this point of view: little girls have been associating the idea of beauty with Barbie for so long, so my idea of Barbie has been quite the opposite throughout my life. I find it hard to accept it.Now let's talk about Ken. He only exists because Barbie exists. In Barbie Land he counts nothing. There is a deep criticism toward the patriarchy which I can understand but goes slightly too far for my taste...1 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"This probably wouldn't come off as a shocker to anyone who knows me, but I'm definitely not the target audience for this film. That doesn't mean I dislike the film in anyway, just thought that would be an important thing to point out before actually reviewing this film.Surprisingly the movie wasn't generic or filled with over-the-top cliches, and judging from the trailer, I thought I'd have seen this story play out so many times before. I mainly expected it to depend on its humor, which is probably the only thing that lived up to my expectations because I'm a way it kind of did. It actually had a compelling message that had decent pacing to lead up to that message (obviously the message wasn't directed towards me in any way, but to young girls who struggle with these issues, that's not to say the message is bad or anything, I just can't say much about a message that's not even directed towards me).Without Ryan Gosling, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed this film as much as I did. I'm definitely not saying the other actors were completely horrible in there role, because it's quite the opposite, I just don't think it would've lived up to Gosling's performance to me. I like Margot Robbie as an actress, and I think she does a great job for this role. And for the most part a lot of the actors here were great too of course.If I had to come up with one negative for this film, maybe the gender roles thing was a little preachy, but honestly it doesn't bother me nearly as much as most films handle this subject. I've seen how completely woke certain films can be, and it's not nearly as bad as the way this film handles it so I can't really be too upset about it. Other than that, this is a film you can't really take seriously because it's a comedy. All I can say is this movie was fine, but definitely not for me, and that's ok.4 out of 10 found this helpful.

"This is the first time I've written a review for a movie, that should tell you that I enjoyed this movie an awful lot.The storyline grabbed my attention at every corner and the soundtrack continues to ring in my ears and evoke a feeling of confidence in myself and pure joy. It really focused in on it's female audience and was able to accurately portray the modern day plight of the average woman. I didn't expect to cry during this movie but I had never felt so understood and empowered to be myself.Margot Robbie was Barbie, she managed to uphold the whimsy and joy of Barbie throughout the tough political statements that with any other actress would have depressed the audience. Ryan Gosling never failed to make me laugh in his role as Ken, he was perfect for this role and I can't imagine anyone else fulfilling it to the same standard. The supporting Barbies and Kens also excelled in their roles adding to the character and world of Barbie.I have spent some time reading other reviews which have complained that the 3rd portion of the movie was too heavy handed in its feminist perspective and that its blunt political message didn't properly encapsulate Barbie. To that I say; The 3rd portion is less than 40 minutes long, if you can't listen to women's issues for that little time without getting bored then maybe you're not getting what we're saying. And this movie was actually about Barbie, unlike the animated Barbie movies which merely starred Barbie. This movie is actually about Barbie and her extensive history as a controversial doll that had to fight tooth and nail to make it into the hands of little girls and inspire them to be more than mothers.Overall, Barbie was incredible and I hope she inspires even more little girls through this movie than she already has.23 out of 55 found this helpful.

"Going into Barbie with having little to no expectations at all can be such a delight.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling's banter with one another, even when they are on their own, are so entertaining to look at, especially Gosling who seems to have a more fun in the movie and is indeed the funniest out of all the cast members.That being said, everyone in the cast seem to be having fun in their own respective roles, living out Barbieland and the real world. But by far the standout would have to Kate McKinnon (Ghostbusters) and America Ferrera (How To Train Your Dragon), who both help Robbie's titular character when she is having an existential crisis.As for the production design, it is without a doubt, the strongest aspect of the film, particularly in BarbieLand where it seemed like the production team really went all-out in making the world, not to mention how they really feel when young girls are playing with Barbie.The film does carry a lot of themes of not just someone trying to overcome an identity loss but also how acceptance should start by loving yourself and not needing to live up to the norms set up by leaders.They are thought-provoking including capitalist feminism (how ideas can make money instead of enjoyment), alongside the idea of growing up which is coming to terms with reality and letting go of the childhood you have cherished - which is well-represented in the fantasy and real world.All the way through, as a comedy, even though some jokes did not land well, most of it are really funny and does put a smile on your face up until the very end.Overall, Barbie continues to prove the amazing directing skills of Greta Gerwig (Little Women, Lady Bird) and alongside her writing craft with her husband Noah Baumbach. With this film alongside Oppenheimer, it is one of the standout films of 2023.13 out of 69 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8,Barbie
"This was the Barbie movie I hoped for. First adverts made it appear like Barbie would be sexualized.But, that is far from the reality of what this art is.Perspective: I LOVEDBarbie growing up. I was not a dress wearing, sparkle loving, 'stereotypical little girl of the 80'sThe movie The is warm but written for women and for love of women-I cried watching it but as a woman of an age who relates-deeply to the writing of this and story line in many ways if not all.This is silly but not campy, casting spot on. Margot and Gosling superbAlso, c'mon Simu (mega hearts)Not written for little kids, but necessarily and wonderfully written and made.9 out of 41 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Ryan Gosling acting was so good that is seemed that he as Ken is the main character.Physically Margot was a great choice, but she didn't give much. Even when she had the opportunity to act more human, her expressions and acting were still more as a doll, and Ryan did a better job.I didn't know what to expect but I was hoping that it will not be too superficial, and it wasn't. The movie is light, with some smart things said. It was a bit too long and became little boring in the middle but after all it was fun to watch. Loved the music, costumes, choreography. Girls can relate to many things said in the movie, and I recommend you to watch it in girls company, you will have fun.32 out of 72 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Thought i was in for a witty, sugar coat covered comedy in which i would have sang the praises of Robbie, Gosling and the production design team. And while that for sure happened, i also found an unexpectedly deep movie, one that even if maybe at times is a bit redundant with its expression of theme, always find an original way to convey it, and really goes some unexpected places emotionally. Truly special, at times laugh-out-loud funny, and in a couple of instances surprisingly moving. The direction is focused, Gosling's comedic timing is impeccable, Robbie's bravura shines throughout, the soundtrack is one smash hit after the other, and yes, omg, the sets are truly amazing.9 out of 61 found this helpful.

"""Barbie"" the movie must be a dream come true for girls all over the world and some guys too if that's your jam.I know my daughter treasured her Barbie collection into adulthood and thought this was in her own words the ""Best Movie Ever""!The film opens with a brilliant parody to Stanley Kubrick's Sci-Fi Epic ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968).Margot Robbie stars as ""Stereotypical Barbie"" and believe me she ain't the only Barbie in this Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy with very adult themes You will laugh out loud at the clever script from Director Greta Gerwig and co-writer Noah Baumbach.Clearly they have done their research with every Barbie ever made and even some discontinued ones making an appearance, and of course all the accessories sold separately.The only one missing is ""Trixie Mattel"", based on the Drag Queen of the same name.America Ferrera shines like a diamond as ""Gloria"", one of the real humans who makes the journey to mythical Barbie Land after Barbie has an existential crisis and thinks about death.As a grown, smart, sophisticated woman she delivers one of the best soliloquy's ever in a movie.Will Ferrell on the hand as the ""Mattel CEO"" didn't meet the brief.I think the role required someone more grounded who you could believe as they make the transition of discovery to this Fantasy Land where only Barbies, Kens and one Allan exist.While Ryan Gosling is the key ""Ken"" based on Sun Lovin' Malibu Ken (1979), Simu Liu (""Kim's Convenience"", ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"") is one of the many other Ken's that populate this imaginary place of ""Kendom"" where their one and only job is to ""Beach"", but don't mistake them for lifesavers.Rhea Perlman (""Cheers"") has only 2 scenes as someone pivotal in the success of Barbies since 1959.Watch out for: ""Weird Barbie"" (other Barbies call her that behind her back and to her face) suitably played by Kate McKinnon and Michael Cera as ""Allan"". He really does fit into Ken's clothes.Plus the Pink Barbie Corvette and Caravan are stuff you'll want to take home with you.What I loved: The plethora of Barbies (including the deleted ones) and all the various Kens (don't forget John Cena as Merman Ken) Listen for: Dame Helen Mirren's hilarious narration that breaks the fourth wall.The Production Design is so elaborate that you'll want to explore ""Barbie Land"" in more detail using the pause button when this Big Screen flick moves to BluRay and Streaming.The movie features a contemporary soundtrack that includes a nod to Aqua's ""Barbie Girl"".Unfortunately the Third Act lets down the movie.On the way to its denouement ""Barbie"" turns into ""Barbie the Musical""with more singing and dancing than ""La La Land"" in the ""Beach Off"".""Barbie"" she's everything. He's just Ken.If you're a Barbie Girl in a Barbie World then come on to see ""Barbie"". Wear your best pink outfit, let's go party!9 out of 46 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Barbie was honestly a pleasant surprise, I went as a joke thinking it would be stupid but ended up loving the movie. The acting and humour were perfect and everything was so well done. The storyline was incredibly good for a movie about dolls and I am honestly impressed. The soundtrack was great and the songs sung were even better. The effects and sets were perfect for the theme and plot and it just worked so well. I absolutely loved it and hope it does well at the box office because it deserves so many awards. Margot Robbie, great. Ryan Gosling, amazing. Michael Cera, better than ever. Will ferrel, yes! John Cena, best character. Great movie everyone should watch!!!73 out of 231 found this helpful.

"Granted, my experience of Barbie may have been influenced by the fact that I saw it an hour after getting out of Oppenheimer, but I gotta say: I thoroughly enjoyed watching this one in a crowded theater on opening weekend. The degree of difficulty here cannot be overstated. Just making a decent movie about Barbie is tough. Making one that is hilarious and insightful and at points actually touching? That should be impossible, but Gerwig nails it in many ways. Not everything worked for me, but not everything works for me in any comedy. Overall, they told a story about a toy which I have no attachment to (and at points would have described as problematic), and totally sucked me in. And based on the theater's reaction around me, I wasn't alone.1 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7,Barbie
"I just watched Barbie, it wasn't offensively bad. It was just weak, and not funny. The feminist rant stuff is unapologetically there, not as frequent as some people are saying, it came across to me like content from an '80s female stand up comedienne, so nothing original, and very dated. The script is messy and doesn't make a lot of sense even regarding it's own internal logic.The ""empowerment"" stuff in it is very generic, a lot of the sentiment is kid's film-level ""just be yourself and like yourself"" thinking that applies to any person, but it's only the girls in the film that make these profound ""revelations"" as they are the creative gender and the guys (in Barbie land and the ""real"" world) are all cardboard cut-out airheads.The film is nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is, it's pretty shallow and light-weight and isn't going to leave lasting impact in pop culture, good or bad, pretty forgettable really. Kids of an impressionable age will most likely just be bored by it, and most older people will see it for the weak sauce it is.18 out of 26 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"One might think this is a girly movie made for teenage girls and may be the early 20s. It starts off misleading the audience into a fun filled ride of jokes and conscious silliness at the start. Later, as we all settle into the Barbie world, it slides in Feministic conversations. At one point you think whether it's an adaptation of ""Men are from Mars..."" book, because they hit you deeper than the laugh you make of the dialogue.The subtext I gather is, the film is about a rich good looking girl who is living her hunky dory life where everything is spik and span. This girl has been metaphored as the Barbie. The girl who understands little of the real world until life hits her with ugly truth (revealed at the end) and she starts feeling real pain and emotions. At first she denies it and fights it and also gets it all back for a brief moment. Later she realizes, she wants to live real and wants to let go of the made up cocoon of beauty, perfection and pink.Entertaining, fresh and perfect Sunday morning watch to setup for an interesting discussion later in the evening.2 out of 7 found this helpful.

"Barbie, while not something I would typically watch, caught my interest. I watched the trailer and felt as though this would not be a typical kids movie. The humor surprised me as I laughed multiple times. The cameos were great. The main cast was perfectly cast. Ryan Gosling shined as Ken. I was overall pleased with the movie.I will say that the humor is catered to parents in some aspects. The kids also have humor that they will enjoy. This movie is mainly for preteen/teenagers. Some parents of kids that are 10 years of age or younger may find the movie offensive.Overall, solid movie with a great cast and a good script. No doubt a movie that was need for this summer's box office.6 out of 18 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6,Barbie
"This movie was so perfect especially as someone who has grown up with Barbie and was in pure awe of her from birth to the age of 12. I was forced to grow up due to peer pressure when I hit twelve so bye bye Barbie. I always regretted doing that because I wasn't ready to say goodbye but everyone else my age was. It breaks my soul seeing young girls, younger than I was letting go of their childhood so quick, trying to keep up with the older teen trends. It breaks my soul because if I was one of those girls I would be crying for my Barbie while conforming to society. Gloria's speech absolutely rocked my world. I need that tattooed in my brain, Greta is an absolute inspiration to women and girls everywhere. One thing about Barbie is I would not have an education without her. When I started school I refused to do my work unless I was promised a Barbie when I returned home, and it worked. If Barbie had not inspired women so long ago, I would probably not have completed my education as I would have found there to be no point. One thing is that I am sad or is a Barbie movie for one reason only, men will not likely see this. My brother and dad had no interest in even looking at promotion or trailers, there is no way I can get them to see this masterpiece, and they NEED to see this it is so important. If there is one movie that can change the course of history it is this one, as the introduction of Barbie did. I'm so proud and excited for Greta Gerwig and what is to come. As a newly out of school 18 year old my passion is to become a director or an actress, and Greta's work delights me everyday because of Greta, I have a chance. Before Greta's movie, I actually never heard of a female director in film, so it never even came into my head as a possibility before Greta came in. This movie has come at a perfect time for me as I turned 18 last month so this is my kickstart to womanhood, and what a way to start. I ask every woman and girl to watch this and I ask them to drag whichever man in their lives that they can. This movie is the epitome of ""yes"" there are no other words to perfectly signify this. Now, after all the mushy stuff, the humour in this film was perfect, there was never a cringy joke moment unless it was intended that way, and they never put a joke in a bad place. I was slightly worried the album may overshadow the movie, but it was perfect, never took anything away from the movie. Ryan Gosling did a fantastic job because I really believed he was Ken, nothing in me could say ""yeah that's Ryan"". Margot did a superb performance of Barbie, it is hard to play a doll that is perfect yet is experiencing an existential crisis of emotion, she deserves more praise.11 out of 26 found this helpful.

"Overall, this movie was about what I expected. It was a fun, summer blockbuster packed with stars and it felt like a nice, fresh break from all the superhero movies and rehashed stories that have been pushed out lately. It's not perfect, and I feel the messaging at times was too blunt, but the elements of the movie that were silly and enjoyable balanced it outPros: 1) best part of the movie is the soundtrack. I really liked it and the song by Billie Eilish that they played at the end has been replaying in my head ever since 2) the cast is also really good. Robbie and Gosling fit the roles perfectly and did a good job of adding layers to otherwise one-dimensional characters 3) the writing was generally pretty good, and there were several scenes that I feel like packed a decent emotional punchCons: 1) probably my biggest con is that the movie isn't very funny. It's written like it should be a comedy; it's silly, it's fun, and it's entertaining, but the jokes aren't that great. Even though the theatre was full, the audience was very quiet during some of the jokes. For example, Will Ferrell tried very hard, but the role he played didn't really have any good jokes to work with. The movie leaned into the silliness of its world, but seemed afraid to lean into the silliness enough in order to make a truly funny film.1 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"With exagerated colors as promised, Greta Gerwig shows hers capacity to create a piece that's not like a bait for critics or those who love art cinema, but a commercial movie as deep as its's neccessary for it's time - except for it's publicity and public attraction. Besides it's reputed director, screenwriters, actors, references for great movies and the most popular artists composing it's soundtrack, the movie doesn't crave to be one masterpiece. Its just a regular movie that fulfills its role. Even with some metalanguage and self commentaries, it doesn't reach a self-awareness that makes this worthiest. The same works for it's social commentaries, that use strong words on the dialogues only to cover it's weakness of some social-revolutionary statement of it's own ideology. But that's ok and not something to demand on a dolls movie, right? Tho, the movie still have some high points like it's dinamicity, comedy, sensibility and editing. It will probably won, deservedly, the Oscar for best costume design. It's worthy what it's supposed to worth. It isn't what it selled it was supposed to worth. Very curious to know the film's future: if it will be forgetfull or timeless as Barbie, the doll, has been.10 out of 32 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Was I expecting more from great gerwig? Yes!Form the trailers, i never got a solid idea what Barbie the film was: a musical, a comedy, a coming of age story, a metaphor for something greater ? Maybe Barbie tries all of the above to a shallow extend. There are deep ideas introduced that immediately caught my attention. Several in fact, scattered strategically at the beginning, middle, and close to the end. The thing is that those ideas are never fully developed or forgotten in the case of one. The film comedy is pastels and pink like it's colors, but aesthetically speaking, not even its pastels are fully realized or pushed to the its full vibrancy like in a WES ANDERSON film. The jokes are bland neither too sophisticated for adults to get them, or charmingly innocent for kids to enjoy them. Margo does a good job as Barbie, but is good good enough for a leading role where the fantasy was being told to me, but I never actually believed it, Margo never looks like Barbie herself , aside the colors and the imposed name. She did what she could, but I never got the fantasy of Barbie. I believed Reese whiterspoon in legally blonde to be more Barbie like than Margo Robbie herself.The film has great refreshing moments like America ferrera's scenes , full of vigor life. Also. Ryan gosling gives an excellent portrayal of a ken with an existential crisis. The ending dancing number: fun and amazing. That number alone could potentially go for award nominations.Would I recommend the film to fans of Barbie, yes. Would I personally sit through to watch it again, no.All and all, I walked away the theater not knowing for sure what Barbie the movie was. It is the weakest project artistically from Greta gerwig. In Barbie, Greta's magic and quirky comedic take on like is muddle among so many different things thrown together; it looses the comedy of Frances ha, and the driving force of nature that is lady bird.1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"I'm a dude so take what I'm saying with a grain of salt.When I saw it for the first time, I really enjoyed it, but it was a lot to take in. I've heard talks about this movie for YEARS, and it was different than I expected. I could recognize the performances were amazing and Greg blew it out of the park with the directing and writing and I had so much fun. But all I saw was a ""fun"" movie about ""being a women?""...HOWEVER, after I left, I couldn't stop thinking about it. Now that I knew the plot I felt I had to watch again to really understand what the movie was saying. So I watched it AGAIN, and I never go to the movies twice! I was BLOWN AWAY. Not only did I see so many details about the Barbie world but got a grasp of what Greta was saying about society l. About women. Men. Corporations. Mothers. Daughters. War.Do your self a favor. Watch it! Then, watch it again! Tbh I'm probably gonna see it one more time. I've only touched the surface.12 out of 56 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Barbie is agonizingly close to being a masterpiece. Imagine your run of the mill 2020s high budget film. Now let's go through it with a fine comb and add a bunch of brilliant tiny details to the first two acts, but then let's have a third act that fits the modern trend of overstaying its welcome and failing to provide satisfactory answers to its own questions and lacks all those fun little bits that made you love the first two thirds of the movie.Without spoiling plot, Barbie much like Game of Thrones and Hunger Games hints at complex understanding of social and political issues but ultimately settles on the safest most vanilla possible answers to those problems. It also, in modern fashion, wastes time going off on tangents.I feel, much like Margot Robbie, pulled in two directions. A part of me wants to praise the film for shedding on light on feminist issues while another wishes to tear it to shreds for copping out in the end.The further one gets into Barbie, the less its complexities feel like they are there to make a point, and the more it feels they are there to fill time.If you're like me you'll leave in a disappointed but forgiving mood. Even if the ending fumbles what was set up, I can't forget my enjoyment of the setting up itself.3 out of 8 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7,Barbie
"I went in to this movie expecting to it to be fun based on the trove a press for it.It does not disappoint. Margot Robbie brought a depth of emotion to the role that makes it a special character and performance. America Ferrera also was sensational and is probably an under appreciated actor for as much as she consistently delivers in her films and shows.Gosling, Liu, and Kingsley Ben-Adir brought plenty of the expected levity for the Ken roles. Gosling is well known for both his dramatic and comedic abilities at this point, but selfishly watching him ham it up and be funny never gets old.As expected, the movie had plenty of ludicrously silly moments that and brought humor from a lot of different directions and perspectives.Specifically, the mini-dissection of the patriarchy and evolution of the characters to more fully realize themselves played very well to me.I could not recommend this movie enough. As worthwhile as any two hours you can spend.10 out of 39 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Barbie offers a delightful and fun-filled experience, encompassing chuckles, joy, and, surprisingly, some deeper discussions surrounding its creation's intended impact on feminism versus the portrayal of opposing views on women in real life. It even delves into the influence of patriarchy, hyper-masculinity, and its effects on the mental and emotional struggles women face daily. Initially, I found myself a bit confused since it wasn't quite what I expected. The movie touched on dark themes like death, which left me wanting more answers, especially since it was mentioned often, but it didn't tie up that loose end.Despite that, the film doesn't target kids but rather adults who once played with Barbies. For the moms out there, it's definitely a movie worth watching.However, I'm conflicted because it felt like the movie couldn't quite decide what it wanted to accomplish. With so many themes and stories to tell, it somewhat detracts from the overall impact. Nevertheless, it remains an enjoyable experience that nostalgically brings back memories. I'd give Barbie The Movie a rating of 7.5. The hype, dressing up, and reliving childhood memories add to its appeal.6 out of 33 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I am going to be so shocked if this isn't the biggest movie of the year. Barbie was fun, hilarious, while also being real, and heart wrenching. I found myself laughing and crying throughout the film. The movie is incredibly well done, and the entire cast was phenomenal. I highly encourage everyone to watch the film, it perfectly balanced real, current issues while remaining a really fun film.Margot Robbie blew the role of Barbie out of the water, and Ryan Gosling as Ken was absolute perfection. Their interactions had me (and the theatre) absolutely dying. I can't wait to watch this movie over and over again!16 out of 64 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Being a boy growing up I was never a ""Barbie"" doll collector, always had mostly ""Star Wars"", ""WWF"", and ""He Man"" figures, yet I like all others knew the impact and cultural historical vibe of the Mattel toy line. This film from director Greta Gerwig which blends the toy and real worlds together, so well showing what it's like to deal with being accepted into reality with people who have loved you as a toy doll. The movie rightfully called ""Barbie"" is a fun one a real sentimental journey a film really of escape, fantasy, a touching adventure that's blended with comedy and drama. The acting and on screen chemistry is in top notch form with ""Barbie""(the beautiful and sexy attractive Margot Robbie) and ""Ken""(Ryan Gosling) as they live in the colorful and magical playland life it all seems just a dream, only when signs of malfunction and a hint that ""Barbie"" might be human the film changes. As going into the real world to search for the cure to become a toy again offers plenty of moments that have you as a viewer laughing and feeling emotions as you really along, with the central character feel the compare and contrast and weigh the choices and decisions that humans must make, and the real world even sees the ""Barbie"" toys in a different light. Overall well done good feel good entertaining film as the sets and displays of pink give escape and fun, even if you were not a ""Barbie"" collector you will enjoy this film as it provides the messages of love and acceptance.3 out of 21 found this helpful.

"The entire cast does such a great job and it seems everyone had a fun time making the film. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are of course stand outs, but Michael Cera as Allan and Issa Rae as Barbie were also phenomenol! The sets were gorgeous, according to behind the scenes, everything was practical when it could be, and that made such an obvious difference in bringing the Barbie world to life. The costumes!!! So much fun, so much pink, and Robbie's long-standing relation with chanel wormed it's way into costuming as well, truly there are a bunch of unique and extremely well done pieces!However, this is still a movie made to appeal to the widest audience to make the most money possible. There's some popular feminism, but nothing that challenges status quo, and nothing too disagreeable for the average audience. It's pretty to look at, but lacks adequate substance in favor of just bringing up the talking point to say they acknowledged it. Furthermore the movie is extremely uninterested in exploring anything about Mattel's business practices or perpetual consumerism. Not that I was expecting it to, but both those potential issues are very blatantly sidelined and made for humor which sometimes feels like a bit much for me.Anyways, if you want a pretty looking and pretty funny movie that'll definitely continue to make a stupid amount of money, it is well worth it!5 out of 16 found this helpful.

"Making a movie is hard. Super hard. Making one for a huge IP to sell the hell of of merchandise- even harder. But, for approx $150M, this should have been SO much better, in every way.Where it really struggled was with its thin narrative and ACTUAL character development. From a story crafting perspective it's all over the place and spends too much time fighting for cheap laughs (ahem, extra cheap) instead of developing a story around what the human experience is vs. The idea of doll-like perfection. It claws to be profound and existential, but never develops past gender stereotypes. As if GENDER bias was ever the issue with Barbie?! Let's talk about female expectations, expressions, and our evolution!It somehow managed to still feel shallow, which ironically was what the script wanted to subvert. Creating something that's nuanced and not heavy handed takes real craft. This wasn't craft, it was a CASH grab.No go buy all the merchandise, cuz... capitalism!!105 out of 172 found this helpful.

"I somehow managed to convince my immensely macho friend to watch this film with me and boy was it an amazing experience! Margot Robbie added a level of depth to this character that has previously never been shown. Her performance wholeheartedly needs to garner her every award for acting. Ryan Gosling as Ken also needs awards, he was immensely funny and showed emotions at the right time. America Ferreira needs to win an award for best supporting actress, her monologue towards the end was just wow!!! The film has a ton of heart, humor and the ability to make you go from being sad, reflecting life to laughing out loud. I would highly recommend that everyone watch this film, it's quite the experience.4 out of 22 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Greta Gerwig Director of Little women and Lady bird did a great job directing movie Barbie. I did not own or play with barbie dolls. Made the whole concept of Barbie very enjoyable and motivational for women in general .Margot Robbie is perfect as Barbie, beautiful in appearance, perky by nature. After stepping into reality , Barbie meets strong women ..different Barbie.. There is a Barbie with different labels... women in all fields. Conventional ordinary Barbie is not ordinary anymore. The movie is 1hr 54 minutes. In the beginning it is all about beautiful Barbie and then a beautiful twist to the story with planet earth having Barbie in all aspects and professions of life. I thoroughly enjoyed Ken ( excellent lovable Ryan Gosling) wanting Barbie and seeking for conventional Barbie in now matured Barbie Margot Robbie. Fun, great movie with lots of lessons for empowering women and teaching little girls to step out of beautiful fake kitchens and playhouses and feeding dolls. New dimension to womanhood is beautifully embedded in impressionable brains of little girls and teenagers rushing in pink clothes to feel like Barbie. Great job , Greta Gerwig. Adorable perfect Margot Robbie as Barbie who steps out of conventional type cast beauty. Excellent ensemble.5 out of 43 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"When things start going awry in Barbieland, it is up to 'stereotypical Barbie' (blonde hair, blue eyed version) to reset the matriarchal pieces in the perfect plastic world that represents everyone equally...or slightly less equal (if inverse to reality were offsetting). While Robbie is an idealistic Barbie, Gosling's charismatic nature completely directs attention away from Margot anytime the two share frame - it really does become the Ken movie for much of the second act as Gosling's character dominates the screen.Of course, this is all the plot oversimplified to its core. The moments of unabashed humor, and there is lots of it, speak for Gerwig's witted personality...unfortunately the preachy tone carried throughout the movie also does too. The film has its moments, even if the ending leaves some viewers indifferent. It's probably worth the watch if you just want a few chuckles and nothing more.3 out of 13 found this helpful.

"Is Barbie a shrewd satire? Despite the existence of two divided factions, in this case, men versus women, which is somewhat comical given that the dispute revolves around whether Barbie's message is ""correct"" or not, the film can be appreciated by both female and male audiences. The work addresses highly delicate themes that are complicated to consider in today's society, as they inevitably generate controversy.Nevertheless, the film achieves this with a genuinely humorous approach, inserting clever jokes in moments where the plot becomes dense, interrupting the atmosphere and eliciting laughter from a significant portion of the audience. Personally, while experiencing this situation, I was one of the few gentlemen who attended the screening individually, surrounded by women, and I delighted in the subtly acidic references and humor about current affairs.I greatly enjoyed how the film incorporates references to other cinematic classics, such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""The Godfather,"" two films that are historically revered as some of the best of all time. Moreover, the work addresses contemporary controversies, such as patriarchy, feminism, and the stereotypes imposed on bodies deemed ""perfect.""I won't delve into the details of the plot, as it unfolds linearly, as expected in this film. Its development is solid and fitting, focused on a main objective of exposing the marked contrast between our sociocultural reality and a fictional dimension imbued with idealized visions. I must express my surprise at this creation since it was expected that it would merely promote a new collection of Barbie dolls or evoke superficial nostalgia, yet it turned out to be precisely the opposite.One aspect that I would like to emphasize is the careful selection of actors, where Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling embody the stereotype of beauty, both female and male, that society deems ""perfect."" Both actors, in their respective roles, present themselves as vulnerable to various challenges inherent to their genders. The film conveys a message that despite possessing a body considered ""perfect"" or conforming to the Barbie stereotypes, it does not negate the possibility of experiencing distress, sadness, fatigue from wearing heels, or confronting the presence of cellulite, ultimately preventing us from being everything we aspire to be. This message intertwines with the reality of women in modern times, addressing the complexities and challenges they face in their daily lives.The film fulfills its objective by serving as a critique of society, admittedly leaning towards an unfavorable perspective on the male gender while taking for granted the superiority of the female gender. As a man, I personally was not offended by the jokes directed at the male gender in the film; on the contrary, I appreciated how the film vividly portrays the simplicity, happiness, and lack of complications that we, as men, can achieve.Without further ado, adorned with a rosy hue and brief musical moments that do not overwhelm, adding to Barbie's experience, even though it is targeted at a specific audience, it proves to be exceptionally enjoyable. Therefore, I wholeheartedly recommend it. After all, who wouldn't want to laugh at themselves while acknowledging our human nature, filled with imperfections?4 out of 10 found this helpful.

"Barbie is enjoyable, thats for sure, but it brings some problems such as the films plot, which is all over the place, and goes in a lot of unlikable directions at times. However, this doesn't bring the film down, as there are enjoyable and smart aspects of the film that climb the hurdles to make Barbie an enjoyable summer watch that caters for all ages!The film kicks things off in Barbie land, and its here where audiences will start to fall in love with the aesthetics of the film. Astonishing set designs,usage of visual fx and cinematography really help us step into the shoes of a Barbie doll. The first act of the film really focus on this idea, and almost shows off the impressive work that has been put into the creation of this sublime world.It is when we delve further into this plot though that we start to see issues. The whole vibe the film gives off and its tone surprisingly shifts into something much darker and political when the real world gets involved. It is definitely far from unwatchable though, and the charm of the characters and the humor actually make this specific part of the storyline enjoyable. Despite being fun, the story goes off track a lot, completely ignoring any form of logic to take risks by giving off a little too many messages that only makes the plot more predictable and cliché.The individual, interior journeys these characters go on though is the clear standout of the film for me. The arcs of almost all characters are played out really cleverly, and whilst the story as a whole is a mess, the developing dynamics between the Barbie's and the Ken's make this film worth watching alone. What is done with these characters is really fitting to some of the messages the film tries to give off, even though it may seem there are too many to process.Acting is phenomenal. Both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are CLEAR standouts, yet all cast members have their moments.Ultimately, Barbie does get messy, especially when the real-world comes to play. Yet its the exploration of Barbie Land and what it means to be a barbie that make this a fun, yet somewhat perceptive, summer watch!10 out of 42 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"The movie starts with the presentation of iconic barbie world and hilarious childhood references but it gets progressively deeper.It tackles sexism, misogyny and existentialism. While it left me crying laughing it appeared a bit all over the place. I believe it would be a lot beter if it had only focused on one theme.Other than that it was an insanely self-aware, bizarre, iconic, relatable and suprisingly deep movie. Greta knew what she was doing. Goslings line delivery was hilarious and Robbie added range to an expectedly superficial character.I would also like to mention the heatbreaking yet beautiful Billie Eilish masterpiece of a song. Great job!44 out of 146 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9,Barbie
"Barbie is living a perfect life in her Barbie world filled with Barbies and Kens. Without the fear of change and the assurance of perfection, Barbie gets through the day partying until she starts thinking about death. Fearing malfunction, she is asked to visit the Real World to find her human pal to resolve the issue and get back to her perfect life. Ken follows her to the Real World where both come across patriarchy, which overwhelms them. When Barbie returns back to her world, she realizes what she is about to lose and how Barbie along with the other Barbies, couple of humans and an Allan, work together to save their world forms the story.Initially, it takes a bit of time to get used to the narrative as well as the humor. Good thing is it doesn't take much time to get me invested in the world of Barbie and Ken. The perfect casting ensured the smooth flow of the story and the likes of Kate McKinnon, Will Ferrell took care of elevating a simple scene with their impeccable comic timing. It is the final act, where Greta Gerwig proved why she is among the best to handle mother-daughter relationship or to even narrate women.There are several scenes that earns instant laughter and those scenes are cleverly handled. I did expect atleast a couple of more dance numbers. Ryan Gosling easily became pick of the lot and Margot Robbie owned her character as Barbie. The monologue scene with the mother worked for me and ofcourse the Ken's breakdown towards the end. If the first hour provides genuine humor, it is the second half that truly make it a thorough entertainer blending humor with emotions.4 out of 29 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Even though she is only a doll, she does not have to be an airhead. Here in lies ""Lady Bird"" filmmaker Greta Gerwig's creative, modern-day approach to bringing one of America's most recognizable toys to life on screen. When you add that to the decision to cast Margot Robbie in the lead role, ""Barbie"" is off to the right, flawlessly arched start.Barbie's aspirational charm contributes to her brand's strength. Barbie has been criticized for imposing unattainable beauty standards, but she also served as a reminder to girls that everything is possible because different models have depicted her as the president, a rocket scientist, and even transgender. Do you know who else has inflated ideals of beauty? Celebrities in movies. They act as role models, much like Barbie, which is why Gerwig's interpretation of the wildly successful toy brand is so creative.While making Ryan Gosling's dumb Ken the brunt of most of its gender-equity humor, this film hits all the appropriate criteria. The result is a very funny children's film with the phrases of a first-year liberal arts student, which tosses around terms like ""patriarchy"" and ""appropriation"" - pretty much everything but ""problematic,"" which the film means without actually referring to Barbie's legacy.The script by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach feels most audacious on this front. The hit movie ""Barbie"" openly accuses the best-selling doll of undermining the women's movement in addition to making light of Mattel.With a subject like this, the power of nostalgia shouldn't be understated, since much of Gerwig's approach affects mature women and homosexual audiences who have owned the dolls - and for whom she has concealed references and deep-cut facts throughout. Even though Gerwig occasionally uses the film as the vehicle for what seems like a gender studies lecture for undergraduates, it is evident that the movie was created by professionals who understand how children's imaginations develop while playing with Barbies.1 out of 5 found this helpful.

"This film thinks it's the Lego Movie but is far more akin to Don't Worry Darling. Starting off in a Matriarchal society, '60s feminist paradise where every position in society is ran by women (this is never shown as oppressive or questionable) saturated with the neon pinks and pastel purples, quintessentially American and girly. All Kens are sidelined and have no meaning they are jealous of one another and simp over Barbie. Through the course of the film this paradigm is spun on its head and put back to how it was again, no fantastical change happens to this world once it is changed and fought over and won back again by the Barbies.Vapid and confused are just a few words to sum up this movie. Misandrist should be just as common as misogynist in today's vocabulary; if any film of this generation portrayed women as servile, useless, and toxic it would be slammed across the board. However in this film woman are both victorious and the victim; the oppressed and oppressor; the can-haves and the cannots. Barbie wants its pink empowered cake and wants to eat it too.I didn't expect a pro masculine message from a Barbie movie, but I also didn't expect this when asked to accompany my girlfriend. I would also never expect any woman to sit through a film that took swings and berated their gender. Is this movie harmful? Yes, a generation will be brought up to hate their fathers, brothers, and even sons. This burns bridges rather than mends them or creates new ones. It feels like a trojan horse when compared to its advertising.Many will tell you it has brains, is well written and is a fascinating commentary on society -some of that may be true. Though if truth be told it is a confused and confusing film. A feminist utopia would have women in every possible position in society, and shocked to see there were construction barbies however that no building had exterior walls or any use of windows... I don't know what this says, but the optics don't look well. The fantasy land portrayed is truly fantasy and I hope every viewer realises that.67 out of 97 found this helpful.

"I am a big fan of Greta Gerwig but not a Barbie fan. I got excited by all the promo but didn't know what to expectThe movie exceeded my expectations so much. It was fun and absurdist but also profound.The depth in the movie is the perfect level - it doesn't go too far and still feels fun and playful but still does deep explorations. It's also just really funny and clever and campy in the best way.I loved the costuming, the set design, the cinematography and the acting. I was skeptical about Ryan Gosling as Ken but his performance was so good! Margot Robbie was perfect as well. This movie was so fun and so creative and interesting.8 out of 41 found this helpful.

"I continuously laughed and cried the whole movie. The acting is impeccable. There are so many small details and visual gags that I'm sure there were things I missed because I was laughing so much. It's clear the writers are intimately familiar with doll play, and how Barbies are actually used by children.Special shout-out to America Ferrara in this respect. Obviously Robbie and Gosling are amazing, but Ferrera brings the ""human woman"" perspective with enthusiasm and warmth. Her delivery for certain monologues is achingly relatable, and acknowledges issues facing both women and Barbie in a way that validates what women may or may not feel without judgement, just camaraderie.The movie is self aware, the auteur lens making it feel like you're watching alongside someone. I cannot imagine watching the movie and feeling alone- Greta gerwig has brought you into the fold, acknowledging your role as audience but also as witness.This is most apparent in the scenes of the movie that other reviewers have deemed feminist. The whole point of Barbie (the movie and the doll's origins) are to make women feel seen, feel valued and to show that you can be you without collecting things to validate your identity.I absolutely loved every minute of this film and I am so happy that it was made. Thank you to everyone involved in this project, you truly created movie magic.I am unsurprised that there are negative reviews for this movie, as some people do not enjoy looking at the truth head on. Suspend any need for Complacent Barbie, and embrace the wonderful magic of this movie.(barely a spoiler) the second to the last scene of Barbie made me feel the way I did when watching Lovecraft Country, episode 7 (titled ""I am."") if you need a dose of that energy before you can see the movie again, I absolutely recommend it. No need to watch the whole series if it's not your bag.5 out of 27 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Barbie is exactly the movie the trailers promised. Different from what you expect from a toy adaptation but not fully up to the talents of the writers and director involved. An existential comedy for little girls and adults is the best way it can be described. It's very well made with the use of extensive sets and amazing actors in it. Entertaining throughout the movie even if it is mostly predictable. Great message even if it gets preachy a little bit, which surely is going to invite a lot of hate towards it too. It also shows different sides of the kind of issues in our world by juxtaposition. The self-awareness works to a point too. But the constant and blatant toy promotion kind of makes the whole thing almost pointless. I mean, I get it that Mattel only made this so they can sell their toys and was ready for the film to criticise them for the same but do they really have to overcompensate for that like this?3 out of 22 found this helpful.

"This movie was fantastic. Leave it to the writers Greta and Noah to handle the topic of womanhood so well. The details on the set were outstanding. It even addresses some of how Barbie was created. Being on the theater surrounded by women watching this film felt like a significant moment.I will say to all the 1 star reviews and people who brought their 5 year olds to the theater, know your director. This was not a film created to advertise for Barbie, this was thoughtfully created by people who have written indi films and gotten nominated for Oscar's. They know what they want to say and why. The target audience for this film has to be old enough to understand words like Patriarchy which is used a lot in the movie. But don't let this deter you. There's enough music, humor, and and character development for Barbie and Ken to keep the audience entertained even if it's over their head.15 out of 75 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Greta Gerwig hasn't missed yet with a film but this film is her first larger budget film. Similar to The Lego Movie, this film appears to be a harmless, funny commercial with a simple message but also like The Lego Movie, great writing and performances make it a heartfelt film with strong themes and messages.The plot is fairly straightforward with our main Barbie going on a journey of self-discovery in the real world, while Ken does the same. A simple premise but well executed. The plot deals with themes such as gender, equality, the loss of childhood and the nature of growing up with such good humour and heart. I had a smile on my face the entire time.The performances are strongest from the two leads, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. Both bring a lot of energy and life to Barbie and Ken, communicating the struggles of being both a man and woman and how one can't exist without the other. They have excellent chemistry and both inject their roles with great emotion. The rest of the cast are good though some felt unnecessary. Will Ferrell's CEO could have benefitted from more screen time or could've even been cut completely. Yet he is still hilarious in the scenes he is in.The set design is immaculate, Barbieland was a joy to witness. My only issue is we could've spent more time there. The score was great and the cinematography further helped with the immersion. Production-wise this film is gorgeous.The only problems are a few too many times of the film hammering it's message in to the point it can become annoying. There are also a few lines and jokes that don't land at all and seem entirely of the time. Yet, these are minor in the face that everything does right.Overall, Barbie is a lot of fun, with great comedy and a lot of heart. The leads are great, the set design is immaculate and the message is strong and positive. A fun film that I highly recommend.2 out of 8 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Barbie Movie Review She's a Barbie girl (who is having an existential crisis) in the Barbie world. Life isn't so fantastic. So she decides to head to the 'real world' with Ken because we've got everything sorted over here right?The film highlights the paradox that is Barbie... and owns it. It would seem that they wrote a pros and cons list and tackled every item on it. Was Barbie an astronaut before women were allowed credit cards? Yes. Has she perpetuated unachievable body image stereotypes? Yes. Do they address both of these issues and everything in between - 100%. Even Mattel, the makers of Barbie and this film, aren't safe, poking fun at their own lack of diversity hiring.The experience feels very intimate, getting up close with Margot Robbie. From the literal extreme close ups to the emotion she manages to give when bringing a kids toy to life. Robbie commits to the role but never comes across as ditzy or dumb, growing more with every scene.However Ryan Gosling doesn't shift out of cheeseball mode but clearly relishes the chance to ham it up as a Himbo.The narration from Helen Mirren, although brief, is one of the highlights. Punctuating moments with her dry British wit.The message of inequality is prevalent in every line of this film and although it's an extremely important message, it could have been done without bashing you over the head with it for 2 hours.Mums and Dads will love the nostalgia and the occasional double entendre. Girls and boys will have fun while hopefully absorbing her (not so subtle) message.By Nick @WatchItWombat.1 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6,Barbie
"I had no idea what to expect, but the trailers made me smile. Every after the seeing the trailers the movie was so much more weird and wonderful and pink than I'd even imagined. I laughed so hard. There is also a sweet message about the pressures of life and society and gender roles without being preachy. It feels like a message of kindness to ourselves and to others. I now know that I am Kenough.The writing of this film was brilliant. It could have been a strange and tacky film; but instead it reminded us of the endless possibilities of stories and imaginations. The music, costumes, sets and actors all were the perfect pink sprinkles on top.12 out of 50 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"This was a very fun, very engaging premise. I don't know if I'd call it groundbreaking, since it's a little derivative of Toy Story and Extra Guy, but this definitely works. The scenery and cast are great, and the movie bristles with energy.I just wish they kept this a little more light-hearted and a little less preachy. There are countless movies that lament victimhood and discrimination, and countless movies that showcase estranged parents and children magically reuniting through remarkable events. But how many great comedies are there these days? How about, for once, just keeping things light and entertaining? (The patriarchy? Seriously?)Regardless, I think most of the audience loved it, and I think most of the women wanted to stand up and cheer during the Mom's big speech. It's a visual feast with just enough laughs and a lot of star power, and you will probably be glad you went.3 out of 14 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Synopsis: Barbie (Played by Margot Robbie) suddenly starts to notice that she is slowly turning away from being the stereotypical Barbie doll with a few changes happening to her. This forces Barbie to discover the real world as well as herself and her purpose as a doll.This film is directed by Greta Gerwig and written by both Greta Gerwig and her partner Noah Baumbach. In case you did not know, Greta Gerwig is the writer and director of films like Lady Bird (2017) and Little Woman (2018). Both these films are astonishing in terms of the screenplay and dialogues. In addition, Noah Baumbach wrote, directed, and produced Marriage Story (2019) as well as Frances Ha (2012) that had Greta Gerwig as a lead actress role and a writer in the film. Both those films also stood out for mostly the screenplay that is very deep and realistic in terms of the story and dialogues. Therefore, the expectations of Barbie are very high especially that we are talking about having those big names as the filmmakers behind this film. However, the results are unfortunately not near their previous films, especially in-terms of the screenplay.Barbie is a film that is in my opinion targeted mostly for adults. It is like the director described, ""a party for everyone, and everyone is invited"". But, young kids (especially today's new young generation) will feel like it's not the type of party for them. As well as the jokes that feel like mostly adults will get them, especially that some of them include some inappropriate language or idea.The biggest flaws of the film are its most important parts, and the main story mainly evolves around them. Therefore, because they weren't done well, the film lost its balance at most times. Barbie touched on the topic of how a relationship between a mother and a daughter can be and the stages it goes through. This is being portrayed in the weakest way ever and that's due to many reasons mainly for not giving it enough time and discussing it very briefly. Therefore, no emotions or connections are created between both the mother's character and the daughter's character with audience members. As well as, using a young actress to portray the role of the daughter that can be played by someone else with better acting skills. Without spoiling, but, a shorter sequence near the end of the film between 2 irrelevant characters, was able to touch audience members' hearts in terms of that topic, better than the characters of the mother and daughter with their sequences that we spent nearly most of the film with trying to connect with their relationship. A huge aspect that had helped in making this sequence a successful one is Billie Eilish's song ""What was I made for"" that was playing in the background during it. I an interview wit Billie, she goes by explaining how this song tells what she went through and felt in an. This can be heard in the song's lyrics and Billie's voice that makes this scene and song very real and original and goes so well with that scene in particular.Another huge flaw is the portrait of the Mattel corporation with its executives, mainly played by Will Farrell as the CEO of Mattel. Very weak, and cringe at times that just made me rather want to go back to the BarbieLnad sequences or Barbie and Ke sequences.Margot Robbie is just phenomenal as Barbie exactly like what everyone expected her to be. She proves herself as an actress that can be added to the list of one of the most significant actresses in the modern time. She is able to play most roles very well and that can be seen from her previous roles like Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad (2016), Sharon Tate in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), or previously in Babylon (2022) as Nillie Lorey. On the other hand, Ryan gosling as Ken is shining in this film. I think most of the scenes that I laughed out loud in, where mostly because of jokes performed by Gosling with the help of his acting skills using facial expressions and body language that suits Ken's character and behaviour perfectly. Simu Lui proves himself in this film that he is better in comedy films rather than serious action drama films. I enjoyed his comedic Ken role here more tHan i enjoyed seeing him being a superhero and trying to play a character like Shang-Chu in marvel's Shang-Chi (2021).Greta really uses all the memes and trends that people have created in regards to the Barbie movie on the different social media platforms, and uses them as the main core behind the comedy aspect of the film. These little details are what make Greta's films all different from each other. Also, this is what makes Barbie a film made for the fans specifically. For instance, everyone have seen the meme that is a picture of the gang from Goodfellas wearing suits and looking very fresh, with a caption on it that says: ""4 tickets for the Barbie movie please"". This can clearly be seen in the film as many jokes had a similar idea that evolves around those jokes that you would end to your buddy on Tik Tok or Insta. One of my favourite lines said by Ryan Gosling's Ken is: ""Every night is boys' night"".Finally, props to all production design, custom design and editing team that was able to portray BarbieLand and all the different Barbie and Ken versions exactly how they were suppose to look with their pink and colourful world and customs which is a thing that I personally was worried about. The results are more than ""KENough""My rating is 8Watched on July 20th, 2023 Format: Ultra AVX.4 out of 30 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8,Barbie
"I'm a huge fan of Barbie, so when I heard there was a movie coming out, I was beyond excited & I certainly wasn't disappointed when I got to see it!The cast are incredible & all seem to bounce off of each other, the story was funny but also heartwarming at the same time, and the attention to detail was marvellous, in true Barbie fashion.One thing I really enjoyed was how it managed to pay tribute to so many different variations of Barbie, shout out to Weird Barbie! (We all had a weird Barbie!)Overall the film was truly a pleasure to watch & I just wish I could go to Barbie-Land, someone get me some Rollerblades please?11 out of 65 found this helpful.

"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are most charming and superb in their roles as Barbie and Ken. Also here and there are some really funny and entertaining scenes, but the ""message"" (you know all that blabla about patriarchy and matriarchy and all the cliches regarding gender from a certain point of view) drag the whole movie rather down - at least for me. For sure the movie is one great coup by the marketing team of Mattel to fit and place Barbie World into the currents of today's zeitgeist - I take any bet, the sells will rise these days profoundly. Anyway, if you are in the mood for comedy and can cope with those ""preaching elements"" you may find some entertainment (like I did), but if you are fed up with such ""progressive"" matters, you should avoid watching this one. Because of Robbie and Gosling and some fine settings and scenes this movie does not crash but Barbie is without doubt just another most hyped affair by the media, and the plot rather a very predictable one, indeed.1 out of 7 found this helpful.

"Who would have thought that a film about Barbie would be one of the most original, fresh film of recent years.There are so many positives of Barbie. First of all, the cast is brilliant. They work very well and are perfect for their roles, specifically Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling (Oscar worthy in my opinion). A special mention to Michael Cera though for being spot on with his character.It's funny but also unexpectedly touching and really showcases the problems with modern day society in an inventive way.There was also surprises that were good and suited the narrative.Some criticisms are it's drags in certain scenes and it's definitely not for everyone but I guess that's cinema for you.Barbie is worth the watch!Edit: actually watched it for a second time and it's just a fun movie with really detailed set designs and cleverly thought out mannerisms.6 out of 39 found this helpful.

"Directed and co-written by Greta Gerwig. A runtime of one hour and fifty-four minutes. With a PG-13 rating.Narrated throughout by Helen Mirren. Starring Margot Robbie playing the world-famous Mattel toy company character ""Barbie"", specifically ""Stereotypical Barbie"". Also starring her playmate/partner and fellow toy ""Ken"", specifically ""Beach Ken"" played by Ryan Gosling.Life in ""Barbie Land"" is magnificent. Every morning is spectacular. With ""President Barbie"" played by Issa Rae, ""Doctor Barbie played by Alexandra Shipp, and ""Physicist Barbie"" played by Margot Robbie doppelgänger Emma Mackey to name a few.With many different ""Kens"" played by John Cena, Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir who's playing ""Bob Marley in next year's biopic, and Ncuti Gatwa to name a few. Oh, and you can't forget about ""Allan"" played by Michael Cera.Every day is magical until it's not. After ""Stereotypical Barbie"" started getting some weird thoughts. She is advised by ""Weird Barbie"" played by SNL Alum Kate McKinnon to go to the real world and find her human.Not wanting to leave her side ""Beach Ken"" hitches along for the ride. But once in the real world, they will learn new harsh realities. Between ""Stereotypical Barbie"" now adult human ""Gloria"" played by America Ferrera and her teenage daughter ""Sasha"" played by Ariana Greenblatt things are far from how life is in ""Barbie Land"".With ""Beach Ken"" as well getting a heavy dose of reality. These new revelations jeopardize life in ""Barbie Land"" as a whole. It will take everyone including ""Mattel Ceo"" played by Will Ferrell to fix everything that's been forever altered.""Barbie"" from the start was said to be different. Co-Writer and director Greta Gerwig said this wasn't going to be a typical ""Barbie"" film and that the viewer will be surprised. She couldn't be more right.This film appealed to little girls and women as a whole. It was deep. It touched on emotions and feelings all women feel, have felt, or will feel at some point in their life. Many women cried while watching the film because of how hard some of the points in the film hit.It wasn't all serious. It also wasn't all pink and rainbows too. It had jokes that everyone could laugh at while also having jokes that only the older viewer would get. It made sure to not take itself too seriously but also have points to make you think. I laughed throughout the film. It was really funny.The ""Kens"" were hilarious morons. Both ""Ken"" and ""Barbie"" made fun of themselves it also had points in it that were referring to some of the stuff going on in today's climate.It was fantastically done with a lot of satire. Even the overly silly stuff made a way to make it somewhat funny. Don't judge this book by the cover you will be highly surprised. So many great actors throughout that added to the film. Ryan Gosling knew the assignment.All ages, genders, and nongenders will enjoy this film. With obvious points paying homage to women. A fun film I enjoyed way more than I thought I would. Expect a lot of different emotions with some hard-hitting realities as well. Once again I have to give a shout-out to the director/co-writer for hitting the mark. Because that's a big task to ask.This was an excellent film weekend with ""Oppenheimer"" and ""Barbie"". With their respective writer/director doing an amazing job doing both. I give this film four mor fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥 but I expect most women to rate this five mor fires. Which makes perfect sense.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin #CosmoMovieBlog #CosmoLanier #Barbie.1 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7,Barbie
"Greta Gerwig, you've done it again. There's a reason this movie has become such a phenomenon in modern culture and that's because it's always been a hit!The writing is absolutely genius with the right mix of attention-to-detail and suspension of disbelief for the imagination. The cast is so random but that makes it perfect, there's a Barbie or Ken for everyone no matter what. Their acting is superb too, everyone's line delivery left me cracking up each time.Go to the cinema and watch this film - I was fortunate enough to go to a screening where everyone shared my excitement and there were cheers in the crowd and applause at the end. It's an experience I will never forget. Thank you Greta Gerwig for my life.3 out of 16 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Family/adult film mashed in really well! The trailer barely shows anything about how deep the movie is I really appreciate that! I'm sure production design will surely get recognition at the Oscars I love that they used so much pink they had to get more. I saw in RPX with my sister Emily which was quite spectacular except for several audience members that were obnoxious and barely seemed into the movie those people like that are strange.I probably laughed at more parts than most people and was engaged throughout. Perfect mix of kid story, The Matrix, and a lot more packed in really well! Greta Gerwig made an important film and plenty of charm for everyone involved. Lovable experience with a lot of important controversy that I didn't expect out of left field. I had most of this up already but deleted and edited out multiple things maybe this is better.1 out of 12 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9,Barbie
"Barbie begins in a bubble-gum-coloured world of fun, fashion and perfection. Although Barbie is played by dozens of actors, 'Stereotypical Barbie' is played by Margot Robbie. Perfection in Barbie land doesn't last long though, as Barbie must travel to the real world to solve her sudden existential crisis. She meets both friends and foes along the way.As Barbie and her new girl gang return to Barbie Land, they are horrified to see that it is now renamed 'Kendom', after Ken (Ryan Gosling) who initially tagged along with Barbie has discovered the patriarchy of the real world and wants to be seen as more than 'just Ken'.With a star-studded cast full of cameos, Barbie's Margot Robbie is stunning, and I think the perfect choice for the title role. On a side note, it was nice to hear her not doing a Boston/New York accent for once. Ryan Gosling however took me out of the Ken fantasy. Character-wise he was great, but I see Ken as more of a Travis Van Winkle or Trevor Donovan type. Goslings' portrayal of Ken looked a bit sleazy, and the bleach-blonde hair did him no favours.There is a lot of lore and fun easter eggs throughout the film that both young and old can recognize, and even if you don't have a history of playing with Barbies (which I cannot confirm or deny that I did), there is a sense of nostalgia too.Bonus points for the phenomenal set and costume design, and a killer soundtrack too! I'd be disappointed if this film isn't up for any major awards for the above-mentioned.Barbie was super fun! It's also a movie that can be watched for many years to come and still seem current and relevant.#barbie #barbiethemovie.4 out of 26 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Barbie, directed by Greta Gerwig, is a satirical and surreal comedy masterpiece that subverts and celebrates the iconic doll and her world. It's a small art house film on a big blockbuster scale. It's something we need more. It deserves acclaim for that risk that Mattel, WB, Gerwig and all its Cast and Crew took. Margot Robbie stars as Barbie, a plastic perfectionist who struggles to fit in with the rigid expectations of her society. When she is expelled from Barbieland for not being flawless enough, she embarks on a journey of self-discovery in the real world, where she meets a diverse and colorful cast of characters who challenge and inspire her. Along the way, she learns to embrace her flaws, find her voice, and unleash her inner sparkle.Gerwig's direction is brilliant, balancing humor and heart with a sharp eye for detail and a playful sense of style. The film is full of witty references, clever jokes, and hilarious situations that poke fun at the absurdity and contradictions of Barbie's culture, while also honoring its legacy and appeal. The cinematography, production design, and costumes are stunning, creating a vibrant and immersive visual experience that contrasts the artificiality of Barbieland with the realism of the human world.Robbie's and Gosling's performance is outstanding, capturing both the innocence and the sass of Barbie, as well as her growth and transformation. Gosling shines so bright in this. His song is chef's kiss! They are supported by a stellar ensemble. Barbie is a film that will make you laugh, cry, and think. It is a smart and subversive commentary on gender, beauty, identity, and consumerism, as well as a tribute to the power of imagination, creativity, and individuality. It is a film that proves that anyone can be anything they want to be, as long as they are true to themselves. It is a film that deserves a 10 rating.

"Sorry for the title, militants, please don't cancel me! (seriously, jokes aside) While the movie is good, I anticipate a lot of memes about overblown cancellations, prejudice, and patriarchy... which I think get a lot of attention from the script. More than was needed.The movie is fun and has great performances, hats off to Margot Robbie, but, Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu's Kens stole every scene. The rest of the acting and cast is just fine, I don't believe I've seen a single bad performance.For a particularly comedy film, I feel like my session lacked laughs. Throughout the film, I laugh in very few scenes, but I also understand that they are directed at children and so on. (ignoring the last part, there are some jokes with double meanings, nothing that children would understand, watch it calmly with the little ones!)...but I have to admit, the movie didn't get me. Actually, it was one of the few times that I almost fell asleep in the cinema. This time, me and my company, we yawned so much that we started to cry from sleep, but we didn't pass out. The reason i'm writing this last part is because i can understand the 1 and the 10 reviews... it just hits people in different ways. The only bad thing this movie did is make me sick of the color pink. Seriously, the theater was packed with people wearing only pink. Even suits and formal wear, I know it's because of the memes... but things get out of hand ,_,7 out of 40 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8,Barbie
"Well, if a film like The Lego Movie can come out and be clever and great, I guess a Barbie film can as well. I will always hesitate when a product receives a film based on it because it just seems shameful in terms of marketing. Audiences will always receive a few diamonds in the rough though, and Barbie is just that. It's definitely the most fun I've had at the movies this year. It's a lot more than just bright colours so let's get into it.To keep it simple, the film follows Barbie (Margot Robbie) as she realizes there is more to life than just living in Barbieland. Accompanied by Ken (Ryan Gosling), they venture to the real world. With many revelations about how awful our world is, the two of them discover what is both good and bad about life. I'm keeping it vague because what helps this simple story become a more complex one is the social commentary and incredibly funny humour. I was laughing hysterically throughout and I was genuinely moved by the end.Certain viewers may find some of the messages to be heavy-handed, but I didn't. In fact, I found that the messages actually made the film better overall. Yes, it's a film that explores equal rights, but it does so in a fashion that doesn't downgrade anyone, but rather puts others on a higher pedestal. I really liked how the film handled all of the issues it presented. I shouldn't have been too surprised though, because Greta Gerwig as a director is just fabulous.Having liked both Lady Bird and Little Women, Gerwig has continued to impress me as a director, even if I haven't exactly loved any of her films yet. Well, I believe her efforts here made the best film of her career to date. There are so many different variations of Ken and Barbie and the performances she pulls out of each and every one of these performers was nothing short of great. I mean, with that said, it didn't hurt that the cast was perfection.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are terrific as always and are obviously the main reason to see this film on the surface, but America Ferrera and Simu Liu were also standouts to me. Each character either had a dramatic or comedic moment that stood out and I couldn't get enough of the whole cast. Michael Cera as Allen is gold as well, but in the end, this is a film that all came down to the screenplay. Yes, the set design is award-worthy, the musical number is worthy of an Oscar-nomination, but Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach crafted a genius script here. The nuances throughout are what sent this film over the edge for me. Their attention to detail was perfect here. I highly recommend Barbie to all ages and genders.1 out of 7 found this helpful.

"It's weird yet fun movie! It keeps getting better by the minutes, had a good portion of fun but also a few emotional moments.It's not made for everyone but try and keep a clear mind while watching it!The casting choice were sublime and each Barbie, Ken and even Alan nailed there performances.The few cameos were also pretty fun, and with a lovely touch at moments.Some scenes were a bit dragged out but because of the characters it kinda felt like i was okey with it.It has it ups and downs but it was mostly entertaining and i think that was it's main goal and they succeeded in that.If you are a Barbie fan you'll definitely have a blast!9 out of 65 found this helpful.

"This movie is an excellent marketing product. Cinemas were full, Even in Baku city. It was very difficult to find tickets. People dressed in pink clothes were coming to this event. I wore my black shirt and went. I think the movie was not good. I fell asleep in some scenes. There were lots of boring speeches. The movie was fun, that's obvious, but I didn't laugh much. This movie became one of the most different and crazy events of our day. I don't think it has any value as a movie. It was indeed a bad movie, but as an event it was fun. I don't regret. There were some references. I liked most of them. The acting wasn't bad, I think it was good. I was getting bored again near the end of the movie. Anyway, I think it was a crazy and fun event, but it was a bad movie.0 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6,Barbie
"I don't think I've been this excited about a movie in a long while.It was somewhat different than what I was expecting, but in some fantastic ways. Margot Robbie was a fantastic choice as Barbie. She shines, she makes you fall in LOVE with Barbie again, effervescent in every moment, she fully enveloped how a lot of us remember playing with Barbie, and what we thought and hoped for when we grew up.America Ferrera - fantastic. She brought me to tears Ryan Gosling was a scene stealer! His Kenergy was phenomenal - in a movie where he was literally ""and Ken"" Greta Gerwig truly brought the entire Barbieland to life.I laughed, I cried , I ugly cried and I'm still revisiting every moment.5 out of 22 found this helpful.

"To me, Barbie was a wonderful exploration of feminity and womanhood while also encompassing themes of patriarchy and the entitlement of men. I wasn't really sure what to expect beforehand but i was truly enjoying it and smiling nearly the whole time. It pains me, how all women and girls will be able to relate to some of the scenes and it angers me so much how men seeing this movie just hate it for the sake of hating something pink and fun.Men aside, i do think it healed something in me, however cliché it sounds and i will gladly rewatch it (would definitely show it to my future daughter, if i planned to have one). I think it's an incredible celebration of femininity and i think women deserve to enjoy every second of it without having to worry about anything or anyone else <3.3 out of 14 found this helpful.

"""Thus Spake Zarabarbie"" - that's the opening message as narrated by Dame Helen Mirren who gives us a potted history of the doll - from it's origins as an inanimate plaything of young girls to it's current status as an empowering conduit for young girls to emerge into society as uninhibited and aspirational beings with only the sky as the limit. Well, that's the philosophy in Margot Robbie's ""Barbieland"". A sterile sort of environment that lives it's life along the lines of a pink ""Groundhog Day"". Men? Well yes, there are - as embodied by the tanned, rippled and toned ""Ken"" (Ryan Gosling) but they are very much the in-app purchase in this world, with little purpose aside from augmenting a ""Barbie"". Strangely, one morning, the stereotypical ""Barbie"" finds she has lost some of her charm! She is flat footed, her endlessly elysian existence is fraying at the edges? What do do? See ""Weird Barbie"" (Emerald Fennell) and seek her sagely advice. That, however, she doesn't like. She must enter into the real world and find whoever is supposed to be playing with her - clearly not an happy girl - and see if she can cheer her up and restore the equilibrium. En route, she finds that her ever devoted ""Ken"" will join her and their arrival in the big city introduces both to a bewildering world of sexists, misogynists and cynics. The latter best exemplified by ""Sasha"" - her somewhat disenchanted owner. When the boss of Mattel (Will Farrell) discovers her escape, he mobilises the whole of his organisation to get her back in her box whilst an equally disillusioned but newly engaged ""Ken"" heads back to his home realising that maybe the men don't have to live quite such understudy lives. Can she elude her pursuers long enough to befriend ""Sasha"", her much less cyclical mother ""Gloria"" (America Ferrera) and then get home before both of her world's are alien to her? This is good fun, this. Gosling is a talented actor who can also churn out a decent power ballad (there are a few) and there is the oddest of chemistries here between him and an very much on-form Robbie who puts her heart and her soul (and loads of joyous/bemused facial expressions) into this role. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have written a witty script that pitches the naive and the innocent in with the venal and the observational. It swipes at all things sexist - and not just from the woman's perspective either - and though it does ridicule the restrictions society has put on the historical progression of women through the ranks of corporate America, it does so in a positive and enjoyable satirical manner. Will Ferrell - I can take him or leave him - is really only adequate as the epitome of the male dominated company structure but there is quite a nice set of scenes with Rhea Perlman (for ever ""Carla"" from ""Cheers!"") who portrays the inventor - if that is the word - of the whole ""Barbie"" concept, and who knits it all nicely together towards the end. Don't be a snob about this, get yourself into a cinema and prepare to be entertained. Bergman it isn't, but an enjoyable evaluation and parody of 21st century life, opportunity and all things vacuous it certainly is.0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

A fantastic fun summer movie! Barbie is not at all What I thought it would be. We laughed through the entire movie. Margot Robbie is absolutely perfect as well as America Ferrera. Ryan Gosling plays ken so well with a great twist. The movie had a lot of laughs along with an amazing message. It's hard to be a women and Barbie really shares a perspective that I think most women feel everyday. This is an important show for both females and males to see. I went into the movie with no expectations and came out thrilled and wanting to see it again. I've seen a lot of film this summer and this was my favorite so far!7 out of 24 found this helpful.

"Barbie is a really fun movie that sets itself up with a lighthearted premise. The humor is self aware, the set design is immaculate, the actors are perfect for their roles. But eventually it turns itself into a feminist commentary on the patriarchy. This by itself isn't horrible, it's just quite heavy handed. I understand why they did it, Barbie as a concept has seen controversy in recent years and it would've sparked more controversy if they made a movie completely blind to it and not addressing it at all. But it's just.. not what you're looking for when you go see a Barbie film. In fairness, if they went the other route by simply nostalgia bating, I'm sure people would've called it hollow, money grabbing and meaningless. There's no way this movie could ever satisfy everyone. Personally I think the movie would've been better with a tad less social commentary and more focus on the whimsical storyline. Other than that, no qualms about the execution. This is still a really fun movie if you can handle a little political pandering.12 out of 38 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7,Barbie
"Greta Garwig is a pretty interesting filmmaker as her previous works on ""Lady Bird"" and ""Little Women"" were pretty good. Here, ""Barbie"" is really wild but I had a really fun time watching it. Throughout, the colorful pink designs, models, background, settings and structures were pretty good as it helps add the film's purposeful tone and atmosphere all together. Written by Noah Baumbach, the narrative is pretty good as it's clear the film doesn't take itself seriously and explores some pretty interesting satirical themes that worked well together with the story. All the performances were pretty good especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as they have pretty great chemistry with one another. The characters were really fun to watch as it was fun to see all the Barbies, Kens, Allen, and the real world characters interact and perform on the screen.Many elements like the narrative, structures, tone, humor, and style were pretty good as Garwig's direction and Baumbach's writing helped to carry the film with some great satirical dramatic tones throughout. The soundtrack was pretty good although there were an few soundtracks choice was that were kind of bad (that Ice Spice and Nicki Minaj ""Barbie World"" was horrendous) and a few writing moments that could have been a little better.For the most part, Barbie succeeds because the film understands itself with its non-serious tone and provides a fun and bright entertainment of a film. Oppenheimer and Barbie indeed makes a great double feature.1 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8,Barbie
"It feels like its been some time since a film release has gripped the world quite like the way in which Barbie has over recent weeks/months, with the Greta Gerwig directed box office sensation creating a global phenomenon that has translated to record breaking openings in cinemas, critical plaudits and audience adoration on a scale that is mostly just a dream for Hollywood bigwigs.A talent-laden affair in front of the camera with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling leading the charge as plastic icons Barbie and Ken respectively and also behind the camera with Gerwig teaming up with her real life partner Noah Baumbach to bring Matel's beloved creation to life, Barbie is far better than it has any right to be as we explore Barbie Land and the real world with our protagonists, in what amounts to a pink fever dream that recalls old school Tim Burton at its peak, Barbie is also a little too heavy handed in the way in which it hammers home its messaging, making the film one that doesn't always correctly balance its oddball charm with preachy messaging.A film that in many ways had become too big too fail with anticipation around the one half of Barbenheimer (with the weighty Oppenheimer no doubt benefiting hugely from the cross promotion) reaching fever pitch levels all over the globe, the adoration aimed at Gerwig's film right now feels like the type of over the top praise that will be reevaluated in coming months/years too something more grounded, with Gerwig and her team deserving of praise for creating such a colourful world and giving us something that doesn't just feel like a two hour long toy commercial but also going over the top in its empowerment messaging that feels like a message swung too far into the direction of all men are patriarchal menaces who aren't deserving of the women in their lives.At its best when it allows its stars a chance to play within the confines of a likeable fish out of water tale where Barbie and Ken roam the boardwalks of Venice Beach adorned in skin tight Lycra or where Gosling's MVP performance as Ken see's the horse obsessed and Matchbox 20 loving beach bound man child bring too life a range of hilarious situations and sentiments, Barbie gets bogged down when it turns its attention to preaching too the converted and fails to make the most of its ""human"" characters like America Ferrera's Gloria or Will Ferrell's unnecessary tickle loving Mattel CEO, forgoing its comedic charms to try and be something it might naturally have become anyway had it dialled back the politics and just decided to be the fun escapist entertainment it often utilises.When fun and adventure is at the forefront of Barbie's agenda, Gerwig's film is an undeniable delight and you'd be hard pressed to recall a more colorful and playful film when Barbie is in full flight but with all the hyperbole coming thick and fast right at this moment in time, it's hard not too consider Barbie's public sentiments being blown up out of proportion as the films misses are overlooked in favour of viewers preferring to watch this cultural touchstone with a pair of (pink) rose-tinted glasses.Final Say -There's fun to be had from Barbie and the commitment of its two leads is a sight to behold, as is the world which Gerwig brings to life but when Barbie forgoes the fun and playfulness it thrives in in favour of repetitive messaging, the film becomes more of a slog than an enjoyment.3 Mojo Dojo Casa House's out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"I liked how the movie was fun and colorful and had a basic story, if you want to chill and have fun this is the right movie, I watched it after Oppenheimer.Barbie was a movie for all people you can watch it with your friends or family.I got my tickets because of ""Ryan Gosling"" I think he carried the movie and made it better and funnier if it was someone else. I'll never buy a ticket for Barbie.So take my advice and go get your tickets and have fun.. so that's my basic review for a movie I hope you liked it and if you disagree with me put dislike let me know if you like my opinion.. , :)2 out of 9 found this helpful.

"Walked out during intermission.Visually, a fantastic job. Big props to the art and costume crew. Barbie Land was incredibly well made. The colors and the lighting in the film were on point.Not a bad idea for the plot, but the movie itself didn't care about the plot.Execution... You may as well get a hot pink piece of paper and a bright yellow pen, write ""Men are bad. Patriarchy is bad. Women are good. Unless they're really attractive, in which case they're also bad."" and read it aloud over and over and over again for 2 hours.The trailer made it seem like this would be a sort of movie that hasn't really been made since the mid-2000s which is a fun (""fun"" being the keyword) adventure with silly/supernatural elements to it. Sillly is me for thinking that that could happen in 2023...75 out of 122 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",3,Barbie
"Barbie was the perfect combination of light weighted fun in Barbieland with greatly timed one-liners, other clever barbie-themed aspects of barbies reality vs 'the real world' and a deep (not so hidden) meaning behind modern society, the patriarchy and feminism.There could have been so many things done wrong in this movie that Barbie did right! The casting was incredible. Even Ryan Gosling, who I beforehand thought was too old, was great and obviously well chosen for this role. Margot Robbie as the literal star of the show was of course explicitly well cast and played barbie like a second skin.There is diversity, modern issues and a whole lot of fun, the whole theater was constantly giggling and laughing. I think Barbie is a movie that really shows modern issues in a casual way and would be an eye-opener to many people (admittedly, mostly men) on how society views women in day-to-day life.37 out of 132 found this helpful.

"The movie is okay if you wanna have a laugh and entertainment.The script is a bit weird but it has it point.Goslint and Margot are so good in their characters.The first 45 are a bit intensive and laughable. But ""the second half"" are enjoyable with a fun and more realistic view.Barbie shows and tells the hard lite of a woken in the real world but also the hard world of Ken in the barbie world.The moviemaker takes up the life of barbies that our childhood was obsessed with. Clothes,cars,houses and characters in a perfect way.The movie has a cirkus plot and a bit raily but in the end it is OK.12 out of 34 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

People who followed all the lawsuits and all the Barbies throughout the years. It broke every single Hollywood Law in the books. Mattel made Satire out of their own overprotection of the Barbie Product. Margot Robbie was a breath of fresh air when she produced and starred in Barbie. This is one movie for both males and females and those who absolutely HATE Barbie. It is pure comedy and will never stop laughing throughout the whole movie.Know your Barbie History before coming to the movie. Know the lawsuits which Mattel brought to those who used Barbie as Satire. 64 years of history in.one hour and fifty-four minutes.24 out of 111 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

I like the overall feeling of the movie. It was created so beautifully and with such care and creativity and love for the Barbie universe It was also so silly and fun.But it was alot and honstly a bit too long.It was saying alot of what felt like important things but somehow it felt flat.Maybe i just like a movie that just is a movie.Though it is so understandalbe that in that Barbie universe they like to explore and acknowledge those huge subjects such as gender equality. In that veiw the small problem i have is they may have tried to hard and the story got lost a bit.In the light of all that Someway somehow it becomes though fun a bit of an forgettable experience.Ps. Tiny Spolier: What about the kens. There story made me feel Abit sad and I wanted a happier ending for them.2 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink,6,Barbie
"BarbieDid you grow up playing with Barbie's? If so, you probably know that not everyone likes the idea of Barbie. Some people think Barbie's are harmful to children. Other people love Barbie. This new movie called, Barbie, explores why Barbie could be problematic. Greta Gerwig is the director, previously she directed Little Women. It stars Margot Robbie from Birds of Prey and Suicide Squad, Ryan Gosling from The Notebook and La La Land, Michael Cera from Arrested Development, Helen Mirren, and Rhea Perlman.In 1959, Ruth Handler, the co-founder of the Mattel toy company, created Barbie. She wanted this doll to inspire little girls to dream and know they can be whatever they want. This thought process seems sexist, it leaves out little boys, who also can be whatever they want. The movie will show you that Handler's idea that Barbie will make society better, hasn't worked out as she probably wanted. Barbie (Margot Robbie) and Ken (Ryan Gosling) live in Barbie land, where women are in charge. Barbie needs to travel to the real world, where she discovers men are in charge and she isn't the inspiration she thought she was.Robbie plays two sides of the same character, at first Barbie is very carefree in Barbie land, and oblivious to all societies' problems. When she gets to the real world however, she discovers things seem to be the opposite from where she came from. Not only is Gosling nice to look at but he also will make the audience laugh. Ken has always felt left out of Barbie land, until he travels to the real world with Barbie. Unfortunately, he learns the wrong lesson from capitalism. He finds out men are in charge, and wants that for Barbie land. What his take away should have been however, is that men and women can both hold equal power. Alan (Michael Cera) doesn't have a duplicate, therefore he knew who he was from the beginning. He has good morals and values, which gives him confidence to be the best version of himself. Meanwhile, Ken and Barbie are struggling to figure out who they are, and want to be.The dancing, choreography, and facial expressions were all done spectacularly well. The cast, including the supporting characters did a wonderful job. Gosling does an excellent job, portraying a more submissive Ken in the beginning, then more dominant, when he wants to take charge of Barbie land. Robbie's role as Barbie was much different than when she played Harley Quinn. Barbie is nice, kind, and not evil, while Harley Quinn is a criminal, who could be good from time to time. These roles show she is good at playing different parts, which will help her in the future.Not only does this movie have some funny moments, but it also has themes that are relevant to what's happening in life today. Capitalism, equality for all, female empowerment, and self-acceptance, are all things people need to know about.There is a lot of pressure on women to be perfect. Women have to go to work, which usually means getting payed less than men, taking care of the house and kids, all while looking their best, which is difficult to do all the time. Mattel hoped that Barbie would be an inspiration for women. Unfortunately, she doesn't even look like most people, Barbie is extremely skinny, which is an unrealistic standard for anyone to live up to. Along with that, the company, Mattel, and its founders aren't exactly honest people. Years after Barbie was made, Handler was found guilty of tax evasion.Barbie shows one of the reasons the WGA (Writers Guild of America) and SAG (Screen Actors Guild) are striking. They all want better pay, meanwhile the top CEO's of company's make millions a year. However, the way it should be is more equal, meet somewhere in the middle. Don't pay people so little they need multiple jobs to support their family, but also no one is asking to become a millionaire. Barbie is a good movie that happened to come out at the perfect time. I would encourage everyone to go see this movie. It was well cast and has multiple messages surrounding issues our society faces today.2 out of 9 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"After years and years of development and casting changes, the live action Barbie movie is finally out for the whole world to see. Co-written and directed by actor turned filmmaker Greta Gerwig and co-produced by and starring Margot Robbie as the titular doll, the film has proven to be one of the most anticipated summer blockbusters of 2023 and a welcome anniversary present to Warner Bros' 100th year since their inception. Now that the film is out for the public and media to enjoy, the best way to describe it is a hysterically subversive commentary on feminism disguised as a cheesy fantasy comedy.The film follows Stereotypical Barbie and Ken going on a journey of self-discovery following an existential crisis, all the while encountering people who either want to make or break the doll's spirits. Before going into the story itself, the ensemble cast must be addressed, especially Robbie and Ryan Gosling as the primary Barbie and Ken respectively. In addition to sharing witty chemistry with each other, the multiple Barbies and Kens around Barbieland showcase the blessings of multiple roles for women to take on and a curse in how that can influence the men around them to call the shots. Alongside them is America Ferrera as Mattel employee Gloria who has as much to do with Barbie's existential crisis as she does in trying to repair her distant daughter Sasha stuck in her grumpy teen phase, showcasing how different generations operate around the famous Barbie line of toy making. Alongside many other well known names like Will Ferrell and Rhea Perlman as two differentiating role models for women around the world, the ensemble cast is exactly what will draw butts into seats.Now as far as the film itself is concerned, the biggest contributing factor to how outlandish it is is that its worldbuilding makes no sense at all. Barbieland is supposed to be the place where all the Barbies and Kens live their lives to the fullest, yet the real world is interlinked based on how people have played with them. That being said, since the film is meant to highlight the conflicting views of feminism in a still patriarchal society, the imaginative execution of how the dolls and people interact makes for a lot of eye opening politics centered around how complicated the world truly is. While it's difficult to say if the film hit all of its targets, especially when the politics it tackles are still relevant today, its humor and commentary lies in the blending of childhood nostalgia and adult intellectualism. This is what partially leads to Barbie's wanting to leave her ""perfect"" paradise and Ken's attempts to see Barbie for who he pretends to be. Who could have thought a Barbie movie would have reminded us how difficult it is to face having to hide who we truly are out of pressure?Of course, the production and costume design are what truly stand out around this ambitious feature. In contrast to the mundane real world, Barbieland is composed of bright colors and make-believe dream houses, complete with a wide variety of diverse costumes and elaborate sets making up the surreal fantasy landscape. As the Barbies function through pretend toy logic, there are some amusing visual gags based on their imaginary lifestyles and how they appear based on what their owners and Mattel did to them in the long run. The addition of much cartoony stunt work makes the film even more hilarious when you realize how little logic is actually in the film depending on the universe. Next to Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt lending their talents to an accompanying score and amusing musical numbers, one can sense a true glance of nostalgia with many well known hit songs that contribute to the film's tone and commercial exploitation. It's hard to say if the film is a jukebox musical or not, but it certainly is a riot with how much the audience will jive to the beat of the tunes.In a day and age where we seem to be forgetting how much fun movies can truly be, Greta Gerwig's Barbie is a wonderful reminder as to why it's ok to embrace your inner child in a world overrun with societal beatdowns and forced maturity. Whether or not you've ever been into the Barbie toy line, this film is an absolute must watch for both the casual filmgoer and fans of hysterical fantasy comedies. It is self aware enough to make us laugh at even the smallest of jokes, it is mature enough to embrace its own immaturity, and it is a reason to still support the hard working crew with how the film industry is going nowadays.1 out of 9 found this helpful.

"Let's just get it out of the way, I freaking love Barbie. So many memories and ideals are connected to her that even without the movie I still get nostalgic about. The iconography, the looks, Ken (~swoon~)... there was one problem though, I am a boy, I could never get a Barbie because my parents never would let me have one. Instead I stole my cousins mermaid Barbie and treated her like one of my most precious toys until she disappeared, perhaps she went into Barbieland? Greta Gerwig's movie seemingly let us tap into all of that and more thanks to a great PR team that I haven't seen work their magic since a long long time, in other words hype has been BUILT. How does it fare? I left the cinema with a smile but I wish that it could have something MORE. Let me explain down below.Barbie is a movie that is about Barbie, the doll, the idea, living in a world separate from reality called Barbieland a world where Barbie is everything, from the president to a Nobel prize laureate to a doctor. She runs this world in all her iterations, until the stereotypical Barbie somehow gets thoughts about death, she gets a flat foot (CHAOS!) and she gets cellulites (THE HORROR!)- she has to fix this by travelling in the real world with Ken and in this she meets a hard working mother and her cynical daughter- fun hijinks galore!This movie has got the aesthetics DOWN, like it's so pretty and so meticulously done with all the details, to how the actors act and how the worlds are built- this is more on how the Barbie world is, because when it mixes with the real world. That's where things get a bit complicated.Example; There's no actual ""real"" separation between Barbieland or the real world, meaning that the real world feels like a mirror flipped version of Barbieland where people act just as outlandish as the titular dolls. I kinda wish that Greta would've made a script that actually puts Barbie in real world, how it is right now, and I know that Greta is great at making reality feel relatable and recognisable and human but I felt there was not much of a difference. Maybe it was so that they could fill the whole Mattel-company storyline in it? Either way I wish that Greta would play more with these contrasts and fish-out-of-water-feelings.This in turn makes the other characters that should be relatable for the moviegoers- i.e. The daughter and the mother feel painfully flat and just unnecessary for the story overall, despite making them ""deep"" they felt honestly super flat, like dolls and stereotypes of characters in a movie. And I don't think that was Greta's intention, not if you see the movies that she's done before where there's always a singular perspective but here I think she's kind of confused on who to use the perspective the most on. Luckily it is Barbie and Ken for the most of the movie, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are doing a fantastic job at playing these characters and it's in their moments where the comedy shines the most.Another missed opportunity generally I think is just addressing the gay history that is tied to the Barbie brand. And how gay men like me were influenced by it- not to say that this was absolutely important for a movie like this but I still feel like it would've made sense, at least the gay doll of 90s Ken (who was made popular in the 90s due to being bought by mostly gay men) made an appearance, if only briefly. I know, I shouldn't make demands about this but I feel like there would've been something even more interesting with addressing all the boys that play with Barbie dolls, the ""real world"" feels very black and white in this sense. But I regress, this is just a tangent and a thought!I love the comedic and camp elements, I think they are what sustain the movie and the fashion of course. Also I love that it brings forth the themes of feminism as that is needed in a movie like this, I think that it does so in a great manner. Is it the movie that I wanted? Not really, but I'm glad that it exists, I'm glad that I saw it. Maybe I was too much swayed by the whole PR marketing strategy but I really wanted this to be a new camp and fun fun classic. Instead it feels just good and that's ok. I wanted it to be more of an adult-oriented movie and maybe that's where Greta kind of flubbed it, trying to make it both kid and adult friendly but she honestly doesn't succeed at neither and that's alright.2 out of 25 found this helpful.

"Attending the prepremiere of the much-anticipated Barbie movie was an experience I won't soon forget, but unfortunately, not for the right reasons. At least 85% of the movie was pure hype, creating high expectations that were ultimately let down.The film seemed primarily aimed at a teenage audience, with its trendy aesthetics and themes, but it struggled to find its identity. It swung between childish and adultish elements, making it challenging to categorize and leaving viewers like me feeling a bit perplexed about its target demographic.In the first two-thirds of the movie, I managed to find a few moments to laugh, but my interest began to wane as it entered the final third. The lack of a compelling plot and engaging storytelling made it a tedious watch, and I found myself almost falling asleep in the cinema.One of the major letdowns was the extensive marketing that overshadowed the entire experience. What made the movie even more uncomfortable for me was the audience's overwhelming obsession with everything pink. Nearly 90% of the cinema-goers were dressed in various shades of pink, and it felt like an extravagant posing session rather than an immersive movie experience. It did not help that movie itself was pretty average - it heavily depends on references and superficial jokes, which can be amusing on occasion. However, after being exposed to nearly two hours of such content, I was completely brain damaged .I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from a Barbie movie, but this certainly wasn't it. It fell into the same pit as some of Disney's live-action adaptations that fail to capture the essence of the original material.Despite having a few moments of laughter and initial intrigue, I wouldn't rate it more than 4 out of 10. If you're looking for a meaningful cinematic experience, this film might not be the best choice.140 out of 205 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",4,Barbie
"It was beautiful and brilliant, didn't expect it's gonna be too good. Greta tells the -ve side of the real world beautifully wrapped in humor and childhood nostalgia for many.Margot is the STAR, she's unreal man, whatever role she does it seems she's born for that.Ryan was brilliant and so was Will Ferrel, both did an outstanding job. The take on patriarchy is nicely done, Greta is a brilliant director.Just speechless to see how Margot Robbie every single time nail the character she plays, she's just outstanding whether it's Harley or Barbie, she's born to play these roles.Go and experience the Barbie world.18 out of 97 found this helpful.

"In the hands of another filmmaker, a ""Barbie"" film could have been a bland or soulless cash-grab just seemingly made to sell more of the iconic Mattel doll. But cinephiles know that Greta Gerwig's short-but-no-less-impressive track record of writing and directing is nothing short of superb, having made two outstanding films (2017's ""Lady Bird"" and 2019's ""Little Women."") Gerwig's films are always rooted in deep emotional affection and a profound understanding of womanhood with a level of emotional authenticity rarely seen in major Hollywood films. These levels of depth in her films are complemented by exceptionally clever and often funny writing. Needless to say, her take on ""Barbie"" is exceptional and certainly lives up to the seemingly earth-shattering hype. Gerwig and Baumbach's satirical screenplay is consistently hilarious from beginning to end, while depicting and analyzing themes related to feminism in a thoughtful and profound way. The film brilliantly threads the needle between being summer popcorn entertainment and being something far more original, creative, insightful, and clever than simply just that. The film's jokes come rapid-fire and are consistently hilarious in an intelligent way, even also poking fun at plenty of pop culture and film-related references that cinephiles will adore.The consistently entertaining and uproarious script is made more impactful by great performances from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, who are both absolutely joys to watch as Barbie and Ken, respectively. The supporting cast is great too, with standouts being Kate McKinnon and America Ferrera. Another standout of the film is the superb production design and associated aesthetic qualities of Barbie Land, which is absolutely stunning to look at visually. While the film's tone is often comedic (which is great, given how clever and funny it is,) its more serious themes are still handled very sensitively, including a very powerful monologue from America Ferrera and an emotionally engaging resolution to the story. Sharp, incisive, original, and fun, ""Barbie"" is an outstanding movie that audiences will remember long after the credits roll, and I truly can't wait for Gerwig's next film. 9.5.1 out of 6 found this helpful.

"I knew going into Barbie that I was in for a visual feast. The trailers showcased the wonderful set design, costumes, and performances already. But I was not expecting how affecting this movie would be.Greta Gerwig proves for yet a third time that women's stories are worth telling with Barbie. Only she could look at the plastic empire and find a story about what it means to be a woman in a society that hates them. What's miraculous is she does this all while also proving that men still suffer in an unequal society as well. It's such a careful examination of the culture we live in, but it's also absolutely hysterical and includes some of the hardest laughs I've had at the movies all year.I know Greta's next project is a massive IP blockbuster, and while some might be worried that she's selling out, I'm not. She'll find new meaning to add in whatever she does.2 out of 10 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Barbie.Barbie suffers a crisis that leads her to question her world and her existence.I've just watched Barbie and here me out, I was aware of what I'm going to receive, it was exactly what I thought!Barbie is a fun light movie that you can't take that serious in it's big picture , you just enjoy the colors, the dynamic and the concept in general... The plot was kind of interesting, it makes you attached to the movie, the characters were silly but in a mostly funny way, it really had its funny moments especially with Ryan Gosling as Ken he was hilarious, I liked what he did here and Margot fits perfectly no need to say more about her.The only thing that made me uncomfortable is that they were trying to send messages through this film, it's not about the manner but the quantity, a dozen of them if I'm not afraid but it wasn't that forced to be fair.Enjoy it, the Kenergy was Kenough for me!0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This movie was funny as well as informing and I didn't expect this plot at all from this movie. I would see this again becuase it is just that good and I think out would needs to turn to Barbie land because there world is fair and I wish we could be like that.

I'm so happy with the casting that I can look past some other issues. It wasn't as nostalgic as I would have wanted it to be but this is definitely a new generations barbie movie. It really checked all the boxes with me. Fun costumes and great performances. It was fantasy and also very real. I can't think of anyone that could ever be better as Barbie than Margot Robbie. This was the perfects storm and it was a long time coming. Greta Gerwig's directing was fun and the script was inspiring. This movie won't be for everyone for sure but as a long time barbie fan I'm pleased. They left the movie in the perfect place and I don't need more. One and done and I'm ok with it.5 out of 34 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink,7,Barbie
"""Barbie: So Clever and Colourfully Fantastic!"" is a cinematic masterpiece, gracefully dancing between hilarity and heartfelt emotion. This modern gem captivates with fantastic acting and a vibrant kaleidoscope of colors, embracing the theme of being ordinary and finding one's true self in a world that often celebrates the extraordinary. Refreshingly, it focuses on genuine connections, friendships, and personal growth instead of romance, making it enchanting without clichés. The talented cast delivers outstanding performances, while the visuals and captivating dance sequences create moments of pure cinematic magic. ""Barbie"" strikes the perfect balance between humour and gravitas, making it a touching and relatable exploration of self-discovery. A delightful fusion of ""Elf"" and ""Pinocchio,"" it charms audiences worldwide, transcending age and background. For an uplifting and soulful movie experience, ""Barbie"" is the perfect cinematic gem.7 out of 31 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie

"On a comedic level, Barbie is perfect. Obviously aware of trending topics and internet memes, the movie never fails to burst waves of laughter every three to five minutes. Every element in this film will become a punchline at one point or another, including awkward dialogues, exaggerated movements, unexpected responses, the Sex Education trio, John Cena cameo, Helen Mirren's epic one-liner, and much more. One actor to be complimented is Ryan Gosling, who bestows a childly himbo character Ken with charismatic idiocy and amusing lightheartedness, in great contrast to his previous sigma characters like K from Blade Runner 2049.In terms of story, though, not much success can be claimed. With the movie's central conflict revolve around gender inequity, Barbie highlights the problem clearly, but provides an ambiguous answer. Although Gloria's monologue was unquestionably badass, both her and Sasha's character arcs are quite unconvincing. In general, the film gives either opaque or passive solutions to gender issues, which align with mainstream opinion, but are inherently fantastical especially with the plain storyline.In my opinion, Barbie's box office wonder largely results from its marketing, whether the grand casting, the luring mystique, or the bombastic pink. And yes, the movie is incredible for its aestheticism and creativity, but the story is overly fantastical and lacking gravity.0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I loved to watch the movie, it had all elements one would have want to have seen. The journey of barbie to the real world was something I was really looking forward it and I am quite satisfied with it completely , the movie had lovely humour and I was completely mesmerized by Ryan's character it gave a very balanced effect to the movie, there could be a point where the movie felt very overwhelming due to a lot of factors but it was quite a journey to look forward to, the audience was very pleased around me and everyone had a lot of fun watch it. It seems like a fun movie with a very deep meaning behind, the ending was very unexpected and gave a twist very similar to the truman show.14 out of 35 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"The movie was very good. It had comic moments, impeccable costumes and exceptional acting, as well as necessary political dialogues. However, despite these strengths, the ending was disjointed and poorly crafted, leaving a sense of dissatisfaction. It felt like the filmmakers were struggling to find a cohesive resolution, resulting in a lackluster conclusion that did not do justice to the well-crafted narrative. While the movie has its merits, the disappointing ending prevents me from considering watching it again. However, it is worth recognizing the film's strengths and the thought-provoking discussions it initiated.6 out of 22 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7,Barbie
"The movie in my opinion is great, it's no Godfather but it's a movie about BARBIE it's supposed to be fun, easy going and delightful but also amazingly brings up the problems of todays women and MEN. It has a great portrayal of the difference between the barbie world and the real human world. The characters are weirdly relatable and understandable. Margot Robbie was the best pick for barbie and Ryan as Ken ( even tho some may disagree, but no just watch the movie he is perfect) it's really funny but also in some scenes very sad and relatable. I recommend watching this movie because of : 1. Humour the ending really caught me off guard ngl 😂 2. The movie not being dragged out and hard to watch 3. Interesting storyline even tho there are still those smarts that think it's basic. It's not. It made me realise some sadder things about characters like Ken and think about the human world 4. Message you gotta watch the movie for this one 😏 5. Great acting, dancing and yesss even singing its a bit basic and cheesy to put this to the list but I find it really impressive on how natural a human can act like a barbie.6. Great props makes you feel like they're actually in a plastic house.42 out of 133 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"I know there's been concern that the movie will be overly feminist because it was written by Greta Grewig. This movie manages to capture the right amount of feminism without taking itself so seriously. The standout performance is Ryan Gosling as Ken; I think he carried his role with the perfect amount of Kenergy. Margot Robbie is delightful as Barbie and gives her much heart.I think the movie would've worked better as a tv series to allow the writers to flesh out the characters a bit more. It would've been better if we understood more of what created the distance between Gloria and her daughter (See? I can't even remember her name). When did Barbie first start feeling that she wanted more than the same existence everyday. Why weren't the Barbies and Kens capable of understanding more than their world? Didn't their characters encompass their human counterparts?Anyway....the movie was fun, lighthearted and something for everyone to enjoy.0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"On the surface it's a fun and bubbly movie. Lots of cool colors, cool design, fun styles and music. Barbie world is pretty cool and makes you want to be a part of it. Unfortunately this isn't really a Barbie movie.In terms of accuracy they've changed a lot of things about Barbie and what Barbie is supposed to be about.When you dig a bit deeper (you actually don't have to dig at all if you're wise and have an eye for subliminal messages, social cues, and agendas) you quickly it's mainly a movie about misandry.Basically ""men are dumb and bad"" and ""women should pursue career"" and they wrapped the whole premise in a giant Barbie flashy skin. It's quite concerning how much damage this movie will actually do to our society because many impressionable kids and young adults will watch this and be influenced by it without even being aware of it.32 out of 54 found this helpful.

"Any time a movie prioritizes messaging, there's an all too long history of the end result suffering, whether in terms of its storytelling, its general craftsmanship, or both. Broadly, this trend holds true even when a message is important, admirable, and agreeable. Case in point, last year's slasher 'They/them' was troubled in various ways, but above all in how immensely upfront it was about its otherwise gratifying messaging; sure enough, the writing suffered in turn. This 2023 film is not free of that same issue, for it is extremely, emphatically forthright and downright strident about the ideas at the root of the screenplay and which it wishes to convey; they're terrific ideas, but literally from the very beginning we see and hear exactly, indisputably, what the script wants to communicate. More than that, this is a picture that strives to be, say, and do a lot, and in fact it is, says, and does so much that it's a little overwhelming - I earnestly think the finished product would have benefited from some thoughts being left out so as to tighten the whole and assert greater focus. And though I somewhat repeat myself, it's well worth accentuating that the feature is majorly heavy-handed, with astonishingly little of the content being given a delicate, nuanced touch for the viewer to pick up on or feel for ourselves. It's a title that wears its neon pink heart on its sleeve, and there's no possibility of missing it.And yet what's truly amazing is that for all this, 'Barbie' is also a movie that is incredibly, exceptionally smart. I can't readily think of any other title that was so predominantly blunt, gawky, and straightforward in its presentation, but which simultaneously impressed with the absolute supreme intelligence behind everything that's being shoved in our faces. Within the slant of being overfull and immoderate, it's nevertheless remarkably well-rounded and balanced. Everything it endeavors to be, say, and do is treated with that same frank hand, and all is blended together into a slurry where no facet is allowed to especially outshine the others. It bounces from trenchantly triumphant to awesomely artificial, to wildly wacky, to dourly dispiriting, to honestly heartfelt, to satisfyingly sincere, and back again, but the progression still feels natural and meaningful, not to mention purposeful, and we never experience whiplash. It is entirely unabashed about the values it wields like a flaming sword of vengeance, and the themes that serve as its very blood: feminism, independence, denunciation of patriarchy and toxic masculinity; self-discovery and self-realization outside any strict confines or definitions that are forced upon or underhandedly given to us, or which we unwittingly construct for ourselves; the need to be active agents of our own liberation, active defenders of what we wish to build, and active stewards of what we wish to maintain - and much, much more. Then, too, it plainly champions diversity even in just the casting, but ultimately acknowledges the advisable place and just importance of diversity, and equality, in governance and representation; touches upon the evils of capitalism, and also the multifaceted elements of what Mattel's signature doll represents, for good and for ill; recognizes that women, who can and should be anything they want, can be and may want to be mothers, too. It's not inaccurate to say that 'Barbie' acts to upholds what are commonly seen as leftist or humanist ideals, yet those who decry the feature as part of some subversive agenda either haven't actually seen it, or can't discern the immediately transparent notion that values that seek a better, more equitable world for everyone can only be said to be dangerous insofar as they threaten those values that work to sustain inequality and injustice.Meanwhile, setting aside the writing which is so enormously essential to all that this is, the film is stupendously well done in every other regard. The cast is a blast, simply put, obviously all having a fantastic time - but for as weird and widely varied as the parts and scenes may be, everyone also gives excellent performances no less worthy of appreciation than anything else that any of them have done. It rather goes without saying that Margot Robbie is altogether luminous as the stereotypical protagonist, but I personally am also very happy to see Hari Nef here so prominently, and Kate McKinnon is an outright joy. The crew put in magnificent work in every last regard, from spellbinding, colorful sets, to bewitching costume design, to impeccable hair and makeup, and more. Editing, cinematography, direction, sound, stunts, effects: I do not jest when I say that everything here looks fabulous. The music is a wonderfully fun garnish that I in no way anticipated, and all who contributed to the soundtrack in any way are to be congratulated; those instances of choreography that we see are utterly superb, providing a level of glee that I'd have never supposed even based on advance marketing. And as if all the huge, concrete ideas behind the screenplay weren't enough, the story in and of itself is genuinely entertaining and compelling, let alone highly rewarding. The scene writing is marvelously strong, rich, and varied, keeping the proceedings fresh and engaging from start to finish; the dialogue and characters are as shrewdly penned as anything else in these two hours. What here is not brilliant, when all is said and done? Well, I gave my answer when I first sat down, but even if it's not flawless, the imperfections here are less about any discrete weaknesses or shortcomings and more about how stunningly busy the script is, stuffed to the proverbial gills and nearly straining to keep itself together even in the face of so much skill and wit. And if that's the worst that I can say about a picture, then I'd say it's done darn well for itself indeed.The promise of a star-studded cast, filled with persons I admire, and the involvement of an esteemed filmmaker and her partner, did nothing to quell skepticism when news first surfaced of a live-action Barbie movie on the big screen. The first teaser and subsequent trailer elicited much favor, but still I had my reservations, wondering above all how the same dazzling energy could possibly be sustained for a full-length feature. Then, to be frank, there came the swift, abrasive reactions from certain people - reactions that were laughably alarmist and apoplectic, not to mention outlandish and unreasonable. Suffice to say that such breath-taking reactions were the tipping point for me, as they elevated Greta Gerwig's 'Barbie,' from ""a film I might like to check out if I have the chance,"" to a must-see. And now that I have? While all my doubts have been erased and I could hardly be more pleased, I can also safely say that this is not the movie I was expecting. That riotous energy of the teaser and trailer isn't here for the whole runtime (though, most of it, certainly). What we get as complement and in its place, though, is masterful mindfulness and craftsmanship, and a jarring, somewhat backhanded, but very welcome and refreshing, wholehearted sincerity that is all the more smarter for the ways in which, sights unseen, it's kept hidden. Ironically, I ponder if this isn't too lofty in its writing, possibly going over the heads of those who might benefit most from what it has to offer. Even if that's true, though, this is so splendidly well done that it will hold up indefinitely, and be something to revisit time and again, both for those who want to see what we may have missed before, and to ensure that its message reaches the widest possible audience. When I was younger I'd never have thought a Barbie flick could be this good and substantive, but here we are: Gerwig's picture is well worth watching, and earns my very high, hearty recommendation.0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"Ignore all of the salty toxic masculinity comments, this movie was perfect.Such a clever and witty script. Margot Robbie & Ryan Gosling played their roles flawlessly.It was so much fun and the references and narration were brilliant. Truly funny comedy & sharp social commentary.It touched on so many important themes surrounding gender, our patriarchal society and capitalism.It is definitely a feminist movie for women who grew up playing with the dolls.One of the best things I've seen in a long while.The set design and costumes were totally brilliant.Go see it! I'm already planning to go again with my sister!56 out of 183 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"As a skeptical viewer, I went into this expecting cheesy bad. I am happy to say that this movie is fun! Is it for everyone? Absolutely not. It's a great mixture of adult humor and fun and kids humor and fun without ever feeling like it dives into one or the other too much. There's surprisingly a beautiful emotional sequence TWICE and it delivers a great message while poking fun at Barbie and Mattel. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gossling prove to be the amazing actors they are known for and this is packed with a great supporting cast. Yes the plot is thin, yes it's a little bare bones and yes there's some minor pacing things here and there. But for what it is I liked this movie a lot. I will be watching again on streaming!0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7,Barbie
"I have never felt move validated as a woman as when I watched this film. It is so beautiful and meaningful while also being witty and funny, this is what a movie is supposed to be. You are supposed to be on the verge of tears and the next minute laughing, it's an experience. Although men will watch this and enjoy it, they won't understand it or how validating it is as a woman to watch. This movie was something I hope every little girl will watch and every woman will watch so she can feel validated. This movie is so meaningful and I hope people will see behind the glitz and glamour and see the sentiment behind it. I'm so happy this movie has been created and I've never watched a film that so beautifully shows how complex it is to be a woman and how the patriarchy damages everyone in it but mostly women. It was deeper that barbie and pink and silly. It's also interesting how the dialogue is from a child's perspective of playing with a doll. It took me back to being little and playing with my dolls and thinking anything was possible and not feeling guilty about liking girly stuff, or wearing pink. So well done and definitely a conversation starter. I hope when mothers accidentally take their daughters to see this expecting something else they come out feeling good about being a woman.16 out of 41 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I regret that I allowed myself to be swept up by the Barbie hype.I'm sure it will resonate with the ladies.Gents, you can wait 'til it streams.It's just not nearly as clever as I'd hoping it'd be. Yes, I was fully expecting a message, but not one that would be hammered onto our heads.Zero subtlety and a deficiency of real wit.There was a moment in the film that held promise, re: Ken and the subject of masculinity, but it was squandered.This film is very fortunate for the Barbenheimer phenomenon, because I'm not sure word of mouth could have served it as well.I love me a chick flick - just not this one.1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"Me and my friend have been dying to see this film for months, we thought it would be a funny silly movie but its was so much more.There were so many emotional scenes that left me on the verge of tears the ending scene was honestly so incredibly emotional but it was amazing.Margot robbie was an amazing casting choice she played the role of barbie so fantastically, the casting choice for ken could have been better but honestly ryan gosling did amazing at his role aswell.Honestly this movie healed my inner child it was so amazing and i definitely recommend you go and see it because the movie actually is very funny but you probably will end up tearing up at some point.19 out of 52 found this helpful.

"Firstly, the marketing for Barbie was great. The cinema was full of people wearing Pink when I watched Barbie on Friday and Oppenheimer on Saturday.Greta Gerwig largely succeeded in creating a fun film that gets her message across although it sometimes became a bit heavy handed at the expense of the narrative and tempo of the Movie.Barbie takes on the noble cause of trying to undo the message portrayed by its early history, reposition the expectations of females (and Barbie dolls) and shine a light on the patriarchy which exists in our society. It's a movie based on a kids toy but aimed at an older demographic who can internalise these messages.The opening act was fantastic. We were introduced to a fantasy Barbie Land which is everything we could have hoped for. The set design in immense and filled with predominantly modern day Barbies living their dream life in Doll houses. Margot Robbie, who plays ''stereotypical Barbie' was made for the roll and Ryan Gosling is great as Ken. The supporting cast are also a lot of fun.In the second act we are given a cause to enter the Real World where we are introduced to Will Ferrall and the Mattel Corporation. They were the least interesting part of the movie. One of the main issue is that they weren't realistic and blurred the lines between the tone of Barbie Land and the real world. Whilst some of their jokes were funny a number of them missed, something that was true of the movie as a whole. We are also introduced to other real world characters who have a bigger role to play.In the third act, things pick up again as we are able to explore Barbie Land. We get an stand-off between competing ideologies which is largely entertaining and funny. In this act there are a number key moments which reinforce the message of the film followed by several resolutions which may or may not please the general audience. There are parts of this act which could have been done better especially when it comes to the overall workings of Barbie Land.Barbie teased being a simple movie about a doll and instead went for the bigger goal of being a strong feminist movie and calling out the patriarchy. Overall there is a lot of fun to be had with the Barbie movie. It aims to deliver a positive message to its core audience however this sometimes comes at the expense of the narrative and tempo of movie as a whole.I never imagined that there would be so many thoughts and discussion to have post a Barbie movie. If you are caught up in The Barbie hype it's worth seeing in the cinema otherwise watch it when it is released to the masses.0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Barbie will be a pioneer and a classic in the film world. She shatters all expectations and supersedes all standards. She is incredibly insightful, touching, truthful, whimsical. Barbie is made by women for women. To any man who ""doesn't get it"", you wont, but I invite you to watch it anyways as a show of support to women and our lived experiences and our dreams and hopes.To the men who feel attacked by this film, please feel attacked. This is an attack on men and rightfully so. Barbie doesn't stretch the truth or make a mockery, she puts life on the screen exactly how it is. Barbie is a mirror.And once again to the men who feel like ""this isn't for me"". If you are a heterosexual male attracted to women, the logical conclusion is to celebrate and enjoy femininity, to express curiosity, care and interest for women. A film that centres around women should immediately take your interest!To all the women reading this review, if you haven't seen the film yet, please indulge yourselves and do so. I hope you find joy, peace and love in all moments of your life x.10 out of 23 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"To say that I was disappointed is an understatement. The movie starts fine which is more or less what was advertised in the trailers where the setting was Barbie. That was kind of fun. The problem is that the second part is just a mess in pace, it tries tooooo hard to be funny. The main message of the movie would have been great if it had been delivered properly. It was nowhere close to be succint. All Pixar movies do a better job at making their point. And for me, the worst of all, is that it tried to be controversial so hard that it became stale and dull after some minutes since everything centered around the same topic.Movies should try to unite not divide. At least create some discussion rather than being a one-way discussion where the writer basically tells everything.Parents: Not recommended to bring kids, it is not for them. It can be dull and the jokes are not aimed at that audience.Despite all of these problems, it deserves points for the first 30 mins of the movie, and the aesthetic.41 out of 58 found this helpful.

"I came in with no expectations and no idea of the what movie was about... and I was blown away. Under the guise of Barbie's beautiful dreamworld, the movie touches on some very real themes. With that being said, I cried multiple times throughout. The balance between social commentary and comedy was excellent, however. While it occasionally came across heavy handed, that was very much the point and very intentional. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling both do such an amazing job of portraying Barbie and Ken. I will be rewatching to soak everything in for the second time. I highly recommend for everyone to watch!19 out of 90 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Greta Gerwig's Barbie is perhaps one of the most ambitious film in recent history. The fact that a filmmaker decides to make a film on such an idea which is equally popular and problematic is brave.It is both a celebration as well as a quip on the Barbie world. Barbie deals with the modern day gender issues and how Barbie (the company) stands as a symbol of all those issues. At the same time it cleverly portrays the emotions involved of all those who love and admire this pop symbol.Margot Robbie is excellent as Barbie. Her performance range is phenomenal. Gerwig uses her aptly. Gosling is cute and is being judiciously used for his charm and handsome vulnerability that he brings. All the supporting casts (most of them are from just one show hence the title of this review) have done their job well. Can't say I am particularly impressed by any one though as there isn't much for them to do. Although Will Ferrel and America Ferrera are an exception as they shines in their limited appearance and steal the show.The music, production design and direction along with Baumbach's writing is outrageously entertaining and often funny as well. The bizarre world of Barbie will be loved not just by the ones who carry a nostalgic baggage of playing with one in their childhood but also to those who have never ever heard about it. Such is the charm of this movie.1 out of 9 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8,Barbie
"I watched this movie on an IMAX theater in my hometown (Qatif); it's considered a 70MM cinema in our standards.. As everything was vividly pink, that particular experience made my eyes very sore!! Despite that, I can safely say that the Barbie film is somehow a funny ridiculous film and I would confidently recommend to watch it over watching Nolan masterpiece of garbage (oppenheimer).Is it boring? Mayyyybe but I don't think so.. does it need a 70MM IMAX? The answer is No No and No.. However, I strongly recommend to go and watch it in 70MM IMAX for the following reasons: the acting is acceptable; the plot is extremely silly; nudity and sex are alomst Zerrrro; you will witness different kinds of Barbie e.g. Skinny, overweight Barbie and more.. Simply put, it wins the Oscar for the most ridiculous movie of the year. So, stop the hate and go give it a genius try.5 out of 15 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

I was all in for this movie before I saw it. As time went by I got concerned my expectations were impossibly high and I'd inevitably be disappointed. Saw it opening night in a packed cinema all dressed in pink (yes the men too). I laughed far more than I expected and had a damn good cry. My ridiculous expectations were exceeded.Barbie is funnier and more touching than I was expecting. It's just the right kind of meta and deals with gender roles and our complicated feelings about Barbie and what she represents in a balanced and realistic way. I'm not sure how I left a film after staring at Margo Robbie and the rest and felt better about myself than before I went in. See it in the cinema if you can. Going from a loudly giggling crowd to suddenly being able to hear a pin drop when the film hit some hard truths was wonderful. Fill two hours of your time with joy and Kenergy! We are all Kenough.12 out of 29 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink,1,Barbie
"Just want to get this out of the way: Greta Gerwig approached Mattel and wrote the film. Not the other way around.This movie is super fun. Where this movie shines is the acting, production design, and soundtrack. The script is dense with jokes however it feels like it's trying to be too much all at once. The big monolgue was solid though and the subplot with the mother and daughter was emotional and authentic.Regardless, some people will be offened by or feel left out because, for example, the trans representation (or lack thereof). It is very binary but the film can't be everything to everyone and Mattel I imagine doesn't want to get involved in the culture wars. Whether that's an asset or liability is yours to determine.Overall it's enjoyable but like Christopher Nolan who also has a film competing with it, Barbie tries to be too complicated and vague in order to seem clever. That being said, it hits A LOT on the head. I recommend.1 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7,Barbie
"The most surprising thing about Barbie is that the joke gets old so quickly. Then, after it stops beating the audience over the head with its obviousness, it settles into a self-assured groove. It's the rare case in which the third act is actually better than the first two. The jokes land harder once it sheds the need to be all things at once - a twist neatly mirroring the film's central crisis moment.As it plays out, the first half of Barbie is surprisingly drab. It's a feat of production and winking self reference that threatens to turn into a painful civics lesson and a generic every-genre-all-at-once lecture. It's not nearly as weird or jarring as it needs to be, and ultimately, the Barbie world is as lifeless as the titular character.But then, something interesting happens: Barbie actually starts landing some punches. It's no accident that a turn happens with the introduction of a fairly obvious twist - the introduction of a strange character played by Rhea Perlman. And Perlman is the perfect actress to fill such a role. She's small, unglamorous, and crone-ish, consistently cast as either a venomous tough or as a matronly sieve. In Barbie, she's a literal chorus, and her existence in the film suggests a knowing concession between the Corporate Barbie toy empire and the relationship that so many women have with her, and themselves.These are the topics that have long churned in Noah Baumbach's films combined with topics that have defined Gerwig's features, yet the movie doesn't work like anything the two have accomplished separately. Barbie feels like Ladybird by way of The Life Aquatic, and when it allows itself to go full-blown existential, it manages a sort of cinematic brilliance that it's rival blockbuster (Oppenheimer, of Oppenheimer, looming so large over everyone's attempt at pretension) simply can't manage. The film has deep flaws, but heart is not one of them.It's a magical thing to see Margot Robbie cry, and while her performance really isn't particularly consequential to the plot, it does present emotional heft to a screenplay that is both dullard and brilliant by design. Robbie, like Charlize Theron, is a beautiful blonde archetypal actress who just happens to be profoundly intelligent and intense, even when the film literally mentions exactly how we are not supposed to look at her as ""average"" while begging us to see her as just that. It's a neat trick to pull off a genuinely flattering disrobing of stereotypical beauty. It's a joke Robbie is in on, and a passive exclamation point that co-star Ryan Gosling owns.I like watching actors having fun onscreen. I actually never expected to experience this in Barbie, especially when it shoehorns in less-than interesting roles for Will Farrell and Kate McKinnon and quickly exhausts its post-subtlety messaging. Farrell and McKinnon are supposed to be two anarchical characters. Both fall flat. We've seen it all before, and here they lack any acidity whatsoever. Their roles feel tired after countless Toy Storys and Lego Movies treading on the politics of child/adult expectations of reality. They almost seem like add-ons from the corporate execs they lampoon - especially troubling in that McKinnon is supposed to represent anarchy. But Robbie and America Ferrera eat up the screen, both inhabiting a particular idea that seems to have genuinely spring from Gerwig's best instincts. There are scenes that - in an overwrought and exaggerated cinematic world - seem to actually exist in real life. To get caught by surprise seemed impossible as the first act ground to a halt.Barbie is a little too blunt for its own good, which strangely ends up being a good thing. At just under two hours, the bludgeoning messaging stops being funny and you feel the fatigue that we're supposed to understand is the source of Barbie's angst. In that, the ending isn't a reach so much as a confident nod to where Gerwig has taken the audience. If it's rare to see a actresses having fun in a Hollywood film, it's especially rare to see a female director genuinely flourishing by being just exactly who she is.0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"This is actually very close to a great movie. It deserves your time and money at the theatres. Remember Lego Movie? How no one was expecting anything from it, labelling it as a cash grab? And it actually turned out to be a thoughtful, clever comedy? This movie is just as good.This is a fun, over the top, laugh out loud comedy that manages to communicate a very necessary message. I loved how much fun it had in doing that. It used comedy as a tool to prove its point. It's not easy guys. Making a satire itself is not easy, let alone turning Barbie into a good movie.The over-the-top way this movie made fun of sexism was hilariously genius. It reminded me of ""Don't Look Up"". That was another movie that deliberately made its characters unrealistically unlikeable to prove its point using humour. There are dialogues in this movie where I was like, it's funny but yeah, it needed to be said. The way this movie constantly made jabs at where gender equality stands at the moment, was genius.Everyone in this movie is having so much fun. The actors, all of them gave hilarious performances. Ryan Gosling, especially, was so funny. His character was so integral to the main theme of this movie.This movie is so self aware, that I wouldn't have been surprised if a character just mentioned the opening weekend battle with Oppenheimer.It has a few problems though. While the way the main theme of this movie is concluded was more or less perfect, I thought the way Barbie's character was concluded didn't make much sense and was sort of contradictory. And given that it's a very over the top comedy, some scenes do stretch a bit too much. It can get a bit too preachy at times too.But honestly, I had a great time. I would highly recommend watching this in theatres. In fact, my entire hall was laughing throughout the movie.2 out of 18 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Scoreboard:Overall Score: 6.7Storyline/Plot: 6.8Acting: 8Directing: 7Ending: 7Cinematography: 6.5Comedy: 6.8Action: 5.9Overall Review:Firstly, in all my years of being a Cinema Connoisseur, it is rare to see a movie sell out as quickly and widespread as Barbie. So well done to the Barbie marketing team!I walked in the cinema with no expectations, but I have to say I was overall pleasantly surprised with Barbie. I thought it might be the usual run of the mill silly kids movie, with a completely unserious/unrealistic storyline.However, the Barbie storyline touched on a lot of serious real world issues and situations that many people can relate to. With that said, it did feel like a senseless musical at times, with unesscessary sing/dance scenes.The essence of the film touches on the juxtaposition of what life would be like if women ruled the world (Barbie Land). And the real world we live in, which is male dominated. This was portrayed well, but did get abit too silly sometimes.The level of acting from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, were both bang on. Considering they were playing dolls, they kept a great balance between having to act silly, whilst still keeping a level of seriousness, so the sillyness doesn't go overboard.Overall, ""Barbie"" was actually a decent watch with a good level of comedy and realism, whilst keeping the essence of what Barbie represents.Isit worth a watch?... Whether you are a woman or man, young or old. Barbie has a little bit for everyone to relate to. So for that reason it is worth a watch, but don't go in with high hopes unless you are a die hard Barbie fan!2 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Saw this kind of late on 07/21 after Oppenheimer. As expected the movie looks great, Barbieland is a crazy set, shot well and all actors are committed.Was a bit disappointed with Gosling but could just be the writing/direction for him. Margot Robbie and America Ferrara shine the most, and to a lesser extent Gosling, Kate McKinnon and Will Ferrell (those last two are smaller side characters).Some issues with pacing or maybe the movie should've shorter, and the music wasn't all that memorable surprisingly. I would've like more songs or better yet for this whole movie to be a musical!My biggest gripe is the writing. It is painfully heavy handed, preachy and full of cringe. This is because the evil patriarchy and righteous feminism is ramped up to 100.I honestly kept checking my watch, was looking at uber's home with like 30-40min left, and struggling so hard not to walk out (i never do, always stay to the end no matter what!) or fall asleep. Maybe it was partly because I had just gotten out of the 3hr Oppenheimer (which I had a strong coffee during) but this was one of the toughest movies I had to sit through in a theater in a very long time.I think most, but still probably not all, women will enjoy it, but for the fellas? Unless you're a self described male feminist or far-left politically, or maybe just a simp, your mileage is really going to vary and this may not be for you.I like Greta Gerwig and the cast but this was a big miss and let down for me. Messaging aside, I struggle to give this higher than a 5, maybe a 6 at the absolute best, wouldn't give it lower than a 3. So I'm going with 4.62 out of 96 found this helpful.

"This movie is NOT what I expected at all. I thought it would be your average formulaic movie, but no. This movie is deep. It explores topics such as feminism & the patriarchy, femininity, existentialism, and a lot more. It uses incredible comedy to make its points, and hence, doesn't come across preachy at all.Greta Gerwig is absolutely incredible, this is 100% her best work so far. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling did a splendid job, as did the rest of the supporting characters.Also, the nostalgia you'll feel when you watch this movie is insane. It's so crazy how similar every girl's Barbie play-stories are. I love that I'm just like other girls!!1 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9,Barbie
"This movie is AWESOME! Unexpected in so many good ways. Addresses so many social issues and complicated conversations in a fun, fair, and thoughtful way. What a joyful blend of comedy, music, color and memories from childhood. Every frame is filled with so much visual candy, and if you ever owned a Barbie or Ken or skipper or Alan you will not be disappointed by the costumes or sets. The actors, editing, directing, writing and set design are a solid 10. I don't think the previews do this movie justice, it was so much more than I expected. Mattel managed to pull this kaleidoscope of a movie off; kudos to the believers of this script. It is so worth seeing once, twice, three times and then some!17 out of 45 found this helpful.

"Barbie is a curious film, and I believe that the high expectations of the general public led to its performance being considered average. The film tries to criticize several things at the same time , criticizing how society puts pressure on women and reflections on self-knowledge, besides that, I assume that at some point someone wanted to criticize large corporations, but all of this gets lost in development and becomes confusing and often it's not clear what the movie really wants to be about, maybe focusing on just one thing or working them all properly would be better. Anyway, the film is fun and manages to get some very loud laughs, and unfortunately this script problem persists in situations that just happen without any development or reason, I hope that in a future sequel this is better worked on.3 out of 9 found this helpful.

"This movie was incredible, it so perfectly portrays the patriarchy and feministic ideas. It really stood out to me how the worst the Kens had to go through in Barbieland was being ignored and being not very important, while the second Barbie went to the real world she was harassed and objectified. It ended up STILL being up to Barbie to ""apologize"" to Ken at the end of the movie though she did nothing wrong! This movie was hilarious and saddening and perfect, and it did a fantastic job of showing patriarchal things and balancing the serious and sad, with the funny and tender moments. I love Great Gerwig and would for sure see this again.3 out of 10 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9,Barbie
"Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" is a stunning piece of cinema when it comes to costume and set design which blew me away with. Also had good songs and catchy musical numbers but was not as good as expected. With a film being called ""Barbie"" Margot Robbie was great as usual, but Ryan Gosling's Ken was the one who absolutely stole the show with it being his funniest role to date. Now the first 10-15 minutes were rough to get through for myself with the introduction to Barbie world, which is understandable considering what it is. But then even leading into the ""Real-World"" part of the film some of it still had the cheesy bits that I didn't like. From that point on though I did end up enjoying most of the film and the performances from everyone on screen. Overall, the good moments outweigh the bad ones and it ending up being a good fun/comedy film.0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7,Barbie
This movie has such a powerful message for women everywhere! The set is amazing and the movie is so funny. The writing is so clever and funny! It made me feel so powerful and validated! I really enjoyed it! Margot Robbie is the perfect Barbie! And Ryan Gosling is the perfect Ken! I feel like the chemistry between them and all of the other Barbies and Kens were great! I loved how there were different type of Barbies in the movie! Being a woman is amazing and powerful and I hate how the world doesn't respect us or take us seriously. There was some slow parts and jokes that didn't land for me but overall it was a great film!1 out of 10 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink,8,Barbie
"When you have a cast as big as this film the space for error is low, and although the movie is lots of fun there are still some nitpicks. Lots of the jokes don't land but the ones that do really make you laugh. Margot Robbie gives a great performance and is going to be remembered as barbie for ever. Will Ferrell is very under utilised for such an iconic actor. There's some emotional stuff at the end and that didn't really resonate with me that much, but it might be different for other people. But the best part of this film is Ryan Gosling as Ken let alone all the Kens are great, the musical number and fight they have at the end is the absolute best part of the movie.2 out of 11 found this helpful.

"I watched this over the weekend and I can say downright that all the media attention and acclaim this movie has received is all truthful. This is a dark-gritty, wholesome and unconventionally humorous film that creates a dark and twisted yet fantastical and feminine adjunction towards the brand and the key themes it lays upon, themes of feminism, social roles, corporate greed, aging, legacies and divine intervention. It reads like a piece from epic poetry, as if the gods themselves had come down and made it. This is definitely the movie of 2023, and the wide range of actors just make it more convincing, I had my boyfriend drooling over ryan reynolds for the duration of the movie and I loved Margot Robbie's take on barbie. Loved this movie.17 out of 79 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"I finally plucked up the courage and wore my usual all black clothes as I braved the hordes of pink wearing women to watch Barbie the latest release from director Great Gerwig. The film opens with a voice over from Helen Mirren telling us how Barbie changed the doll business, no longer did young girls just have dolls that were encouraging them to stay in the kitchen now they had barbie who could have any career with the change of an outfit. Straight away this should tell you about the gender politics of this film but more on that later. We then cut to Barbieland where everything is plastic and fantastic that is until one day Barbie out loud says do you ever think about death? (Is there not a therapist barbie?). From there starts an adventure where Barbie and Ken travel to the real world, barbie in search of her owner to find the source of her new found depressive thoughts and Ken well in search of Barbies heart.This film is a hard one to unpick as it's just chaos, there's so much going on all the time, so much so that the slower moments act as nice breathers for the audience. There's dance sequences, action sequences, jokes, gender politics and somewhere in here there's the typical Barbie plot that you might presume this film would have but it's covered with loads of other stuff. The thing I'm most torn on with this film is that I want to praise Gerwig for creating a Barbie film that no one would have predicted while at the same time I can't help wondering if I personally would have enjoyed it more had it been more generic. I'm always talking about how films should be more creative and yet this is the question this film has me asking myself. It's just different and it definitely isn't a kids film, a young girl sat a couple of rows behind me had to keep asking her mum what was going on and I don't blame her as if I was 6,7,8 years old I wouldn't have had a clue. This film seems to be aimed at women Greta's age which is a surprise to me as I thought she was in her late twenties for some reason but you can Google her actual age if you wish to know. Now I know her actual age some of the more older niche references to bands and films etc make more sense and I think it's women that are a similar age to her that she's trying to appeal to here.That brings me onto the films central theming which is its gender politics. It's a film that's about women and for women and in that it does a great job, I think for its target audience it could be an impactful and empowering piece of art. That being said however if you're a pre teen girl or a man you might not get the full emotional impact of this film and I feel that's a bit of a missed opportunity. If this film had eased up on the gender politics at times I think it could have appealed to a wider audience and in doing so may have been able to spread the films message further but I think it's largely ended up falling on death ears to those who aren't in its target audience. It's a shame because the film has an important message to share about equality but it's one that men need to get onboard with as much as women to bring about any real change.By the way, for a film that's supposed to be telling women to be who they are and challenge the patriarchy why has a trend been created for women to wear pink to this film considering it's one of the most commonly associated colours with women?Overall I'm not the target audience for this film but I had a good time nonetheless, it's not one I'll be hurrying back too with haste though.0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"This is not a great movie - when you get down to it, it's not even a good movie. It's a popcorn movie at best. The best thing it has going for it? Margot Robbie as Barbie: she does channel the role well and when her world turns upside down, you genuinely feel sorry for her. At the other end of the scale - Ryan Gosling as Ken. Gosling is good at stretching into roles, but no matter what - Ken was an androgenous doll and Gosling can't stretch the role anything more than that. He looks like a character out of ZOOLANDER and whenever he is on the screen, i was cringing in my seat. There are definitely funny moments: my favorite? When Ken runs into the ocean to surf. Definitely a woman's movie from the first preach to the final cast roll - it got old fast and the screenplay didn't seem to have much substance after the ""I am woman"" speeches. I thought it was me, but there was a lot of kids in the theatre and they all appeared to be bored as well. Sorry Greta => This is not your ticket to the Oscars.3 out of 3 found this helpful.

"A Barbie movie helmed by Greta Gerwig starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling... what could possibly go wrong? Practically nothing it seems, as this movie is a complete knock out in every possible way.It is hilarious from start to finish with a sharply funny, meta, intelligent script that is matched by the masterfully executed physical comedy.The story is emotional and powerful and meaningful which I did not expect, but this proved to be such a vital and welcome part of the film.The entire cast is brilliant with outrageously camp performances from them all, but the highlights are the two leads. I can't think of two better people suited for the roles than Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. They both give perfectly flawless performances, filled with heart and humour and charisma. Will Ferrell is a scene-stealer with some hilarious comedy as you'd expect, and America Ferrera delivers a great performance with a lot of heart.The visuals are so fun from the sets through to the costumes. It is such a vibrant and colourful film that bursts with creativity, and to top it all off it has a superb soundtrack as well.If you were once a Barbie movie sceptic like me, then think again as it does not disappoint!0 out of 6 found this helpful.

"It's hard to say this movie isn't great even if you don't agree with the third act feminism part. I mean, Margot Robbie nailed it! And Ryan Gosling... come on, i was expecting so much from him, and he was even better than i tought, so freaking funny and always on point! The set production and Costume design are, of course, oscar nominees already.Overall i liked the message, the social critic, the perfomances, the production, the jokes were very funny, the references... what's there not to like? Such an enjoyable movie. Perhaps the part played by America Ferrera required a most skilled actress to carry the emotive part of the movie and the monologue in a more convincing way, but that doesn't ruin the movie at all. I think it's a must watch for cinema lovers and for people who just wanna have a good time as well.3 out of 22 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7,Barbie
"Barbie is a fantastic movie, it's so layered, bold and smart. Brilliant writing, directing, acting, costumes and set design wow. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are amazing in it. Also America Ferrera, what a performance (her monologue in one scene has us gagged in the cinema).Greta Gerwig created a clever, charming and fun movie that will have you laugh, smile and clap. It will also have you thinking about our individual role and place in the world. A breath of fresh air in the world of cinema and one that is needed for these challenging times we're in.Margot Robbie as Barbie was like she was born to play the role. But still, imo Ken(played by literally me) stole the show.A solid 8.12 out of 65 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8,Barbie
At the interval I was surprised of how much I was enjoying Barbie with its amazing humour which was super ironic and subtle commentary on male patriarchy and consumerism. The overall theme of the movie was also quite good reflecting many aspects of human life and how it becomes more critical with age. But it was so disappointing in the third act which takes away the brilliant build up. Ryan Gosling showed his ranged and made me laugh so many times. Margot Robbie shined brilliantly just like she does during the whole film. But I expected more from Barbie and Greta Gerwig didn't satisfy me. She should have tried for a different sort of ending.0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink,6,Barbie
"Barbie changed me for the better. It made me appreciate being a woman all over again, it made me appreciate my mother more and it made me more grateful to have 3 little girls. It'll make Barbie playtime more special and fun. It'll be a staple in my home and something that grows with me and my girls. It was funny, emotional, energetic and wholesome. Every time Barbie cried, I cried. Every time she laughed , I laughed. Growing up Barbie was my go to toy , it brought me comfort and fun. And as I had my girls it brings me joy to stand in the Barbie aisle as they pick out their favorite Barbie. Thank you so much for this movie. 💕17 out of 46 found this helpful.

Now please take into consideration that I am a man. And a white man at that.Barbie was much better than I thought it was going to be. I'm just going to get into what I didn't like. Barbie starts off as a fun light hearted comedy movie. The first 30 mins are great! From then on the movie begins to have an identity crisis. It goes from deep feminist themes to a car commercial to a slide show to a 4th wall break depression Barbie ad and then a musical. One of my biggest problems was that I felt like the movie was talking to the audience too much. Things were being said or done visually in the movie not for the sake of the story but for the audience. Which maybe some people like but to me it kinda took me out of the experience.Barbie wanted to be taken seriously but because of its inability to be consistent and justify the actions of certain characters and events it left the audience behind.Like what is the purpose of Mr. Buisness(Will Ferrall)? Is he good? Is he evil? Does he care? Does he just want money? Why does he ask like a Barbie but he's from the real world?At the end of the day I agree with a lot of what was being said and the themes that were built. I just don't think the movie is for me... at all. But I didn't hate it and Ryan Gosling gets a 💯.0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink,6,Barbie
"I found Barbie to be funny, self-deprecating, intelligent and masterfully pretty. The choice of making Barbieworld feel plastic adds an incredible layer of humor to it all.Gosling, Margot Robbie and cast are a charming ensemble of top tier performers giving their all and it shows. Robbie's self-serious approach to Barbie makes Gosling's self-seriousness as Ken even funnier.When I left Barbie, all I could think is ""This movie is SO PG-13"" in the best way possible. It's sexless, while also acknowledging sex and physical attraction. It's crude without raunchy language. It's self-deprecating humor is second to none. It's absurdist humor is uniquely millennial/Gen Z. I found this film hilarious and fun.I recommend everyone watches this and also doesn't take it too seriously.2 out of 10 found this helpful.

"I went in there with O expectations, but boy, it was cunning and audacious to say the least! It is one the most original movie made in terms of writing, filming, cinematography, in recent times to be made with a fake subject but very relevant plot!Barbie speaks to alot of women and MEN about feminism, patriarchy, consumerism and existentialism in its own weird, sometimes cringe but mostly funny way.Full Marks for Casting. Top to toe perfect casting for Barbie and Ken. But movié is boring in the beginning and too preachy otherwise.Totally skippable in the theatres. Its not worth the hype tbh.0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6,Barbie
"""Barbie"" should be the only movie I can give 10 this year. Both the rhythm of the plot, the tribute to the toy are perfect. Also, from feminism and women's own awakening to the awakening of self is the perfect theme. The plot in the middle of the movie is also very funny and the musical cooperation makes the whole comedy level of the movie to a higher level. By the way, the clothes, buildings, stage properties is a great tribute to toys. In the video, you can see the different Barbies is or was sold in the market, and each Barbie is very distinctive and easy to identify. Let's hope Mattel releases more and better Barbie in the coming years. I really hope you guys could come to cinema and see this movie.52 out of 191 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Barbie is an anomaly, a force of nature, and could potentially be some sort of trendsetter in ways I can't quite fathom yet. I never expected a good Barbie movie to exist, especially not one that is so poignant and rich with satire, ambition, and intellect. But, this movie isn't just good - it's fantastic.Choosing to make ""facade"" one of the primary focuses of the film was probably the most brilliant thing that writer/director Greta Gerwig could have done, because it allows the movie to function as a wholly progressive and often quite meta experience. Though the movie only goes back and forth between Barbie Land and ""reality"", I felt as if I traversed through 5 or 6 different dimensions throughout the course of the film. The movie has so many layers, I'm not even sure how Gerwig made it work - maybe it was luck, maybe it was an incredibly talented cast & crew, or maybe she's just a genius.What's most important is that the movie is hilarious, all the way through. There weren't many segments where a giant smile was not plastered across my face. Though the choices for comedic roles could be perceived as cliche, all of them murdered the game with their characters, that being Michael Cera as Allan, Kate McKinnon as Weird Barbie, and of course Will Ferrell as the CEO of Mattel. But, it's Ryan Gosling that truly steals the show as the funniest part of the entire film. Of course, it's the brilliant writing that allows it, but Gosling's commitment to bringing to life one of the greatest exaggerations of masculinity I have ever seen put to screen is diamond-level. The way the movie spotlights parallels between straight-guy masculinity and gayness, as both a joke and an astute observation, is incredible and done in a way I've never seen pulled off before.It should be said that what allows a comedy to transcend the bone-headed standards that the genre usually plants itself in, is a script that actually has something to say, from the heart and from the brain. I figured it would poke fun at certain gender tropes and politics, but I didn't expect Barbie to be full of so much existential philosophy. At times it almost felt like Charlie Kaufman LITE, but in a GOOD WAY. Though most of the film is full of laughs, it also has several segments that will suddenly take you to realms of sheer reflection and a surprising amount of emotional resonance. I think a lot of people had to get over an ""am I about to cry at a Barbie movie?"" hump, but...I want you to know that you should cry at this movie! It's both nostalgic and totally ahead of its time at the same time. It's actually a very serious and important film underneath all the pink & the laughs.And on that note, it's not surprising that so many dudes are already calling it a horrible movie and overly woke feminist propaganda, but it's definitely lame of them, and in my opinion, wrong. I think a lot of these people are missing a lot of the points and the jokes. Though on the surface the movie seems to be poking most fun at men, it pokes just as much fun at femininity, society, and the human experience as a whole. It has a lot of critical things to say about all of them. Plus, if you can't laugh at your own kind, especially when it's done so articulately, with so much love, I really think you're doing it all wrong.It comes as no surprise that Margot Robbie carries the film wonderfully. The soundtrack is also a ton of fun. But the most exciting part here, ""as a fan of the cinema"", is knowing that this is going to take Greta Gerwig to the absolute top of the totem pole. She's been such an interesting, tasteful, and likable multi-faceted presence, between acting, writing, and directing, and I'm very curious and excited to see what she does with her power after this.0 out of 7 found this helpful.

"Barbie movie was alright. Some scenes were quite cringe and the movie was not that super funny after all. Jokes here and there were sexually but that was it. Nowadays, I believe it is a good thing that the characters in the movie are all people from color. What is still a mystery and confusing is how they left the Barbieworld to the real world and vice versa... Besides the storyline was sometimes random and out of the blue how things turned out. I wouldn't definitely watch this movie again. Though, I would watch it as a drinking game, whenever someone says Barbie you have to take a shot. Cuz damn that word is being said sooo many times!5 out of 30 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7,Barbie
"Barbie has exceeded the expectations of many viewers, what we thought was going to be a movie for ""kids"" has ended up being a movie full of social criticism, satire and a great sense of humor. The female empowerment that Greta Gerwig presents to us is relentless, showing various situations in which women find themselves involved on a daily basis, as well as various cliches that surround them.On the other hand, there is Ken who at first finds patriarchy as the best solution for society, but finally realizes that the role of women is extremely important and that without them society would collapse.The way in which Barbie has been shot is impressive, the mixture of the use of animated elements with life action makes seeing Barbie on the big screen a unique experience. I loved the duo of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, they have coexisted perfectly in Barbieland, making watching them act extremely entertaining.Without a doubt, this movie is one of a kind and I would like it to be valued for what it really is and not be forgotten like the movie about Barbie.11 out of 48 found this helpful.

"So, I didn't have that much of a high expectation going in to see this because I really wasn't sure what is was going to be. I grew up playing Barbie's and have watched the animated films many times with my kids.The movie from start to finish is so thoughtfully executed. It's for everyone, but mainly young girls need to see this. It's a great reminder of how special we are as women and how special ALL of us are individually as a person and the life we get to experience.Another fantastic element is adding a very 90s feel to the film. You will laugh like you used to laugh when fun comedies would come out in theatre's years ago. I haven't seen just a good comedy with heart in years.I brought my 7yr old and we dressed up for it too. I wanted her to see me comfortable in my own skin and her as well and the film touches on that. It's suited for any age, regardless of the rating.I don't give high ratings like this to films usually, as I find small things usually that I wish had been addressed more... but not in Barbie. What a fun movie and a great time you'll have watching this in theatre (or at home) knowing it's your childhood come to life.31 out of 99 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"""I want to do the imagining. I don't want to be the idea."".When my kid informed me he and his friends were going to see a Barbie movie, I couldn't believe it. The stereotypical mother in me instantly responded. Seeing as how MI and IJ were running in parallel in theatres, I was taken aback and asked him why a group of boys would be interested in seeing Barbie. Will there be any girls there? I'm guessing I probably sounded kind of dorky in his ears. His response, though, was typical of his generation:This is a spoof and not a movie aimed at just girls, Mom. But, like any mother, I made arrangements to watch the movie myself before he did. Also, the other reason was that as a kid, I had eight dolls, and the majority of my time went into playing with them and building stories. And only Barbie was one of those dolls whose identity was recognised consistently over the globe. Barbie therefore represents the shared imagination of all kids who play with it across the world.It was the right decision to see this film because otherwise I would not have realised what a brilliant move it was for the brand to reach out to younger consumers. Barbie is a great gimmick for a rebranding campaign to appeal to Generation Z, which places an emphasis on pragmatics.We all know that Barbie has a checkered history. Barbie's version as a math-averse doll was not received well. Barbie, packaged with a ""don't eat"" diet handbook, protested. Someone who seems black on the exterior but is really white on the inside was being mocked by Oreao's crazy cookie Barbie. The creepiest thing was pregnant Barbie with babies in her belly, and the oddest thing was when Barbie went through puberty. Hijab Barbie and Virus Barbie both sparked new debates. Parents were largely concerned about the FBI tip of a security threat regarding the Video Girl Barbie.Most criticised among Gen Z was Barbie's excessively slender body, which has been an undesirable role model for women. It precisely articulates the enormous problem of existential crises that the outside world has manufactured and which individuals have mindlessly embraced.To begin with, the film explored the same themes, including the existential difficulties brought on by the persistence of patriarchy and Barbie stereotypes. The story starts with Barbie living a happy life in Barbieland, but she notices that she is developing human consciousness. To find answers, she has to travel to the real world in order to restore normality. As she and Ken enter the real world, Barbie is overwhelmed to see the many ways in which women are treated as objects and devalued. Multiple sets of eyes scrutinise all of their actions. Both Barbie and Ken's masculine awakenings also go through existential crises. Later in the movie, with Ken's changed behaviour after going to the real world, Barbie's attempt to appease Ken's manly ego by playing a weakling is satire. However, the much-touted ""gender war"" is seen humorously despite the fact that it still exists, whether people accept it or not.Now, coming to the technical part of the film, the Barbie-land segment was overdone. The transition from Barbie Land to the actual world was also too long; a crisp cut here, as in Jumanji, would have made more sense. So the movie has a sluggish start, but it picks up speed and becomes engaging as time goes on. The humour was really cliched and cheap, so that wasn't great.Both Margot's and Ryan's performances were excellent. While the actors were all spot-on, the film's direction let it down by not keeping the action moving at a good clip and by delivering a confusing muddle of a plot and a message that left viewers with no clear conclusions. A more succinct conclusion would have been fantastic. Though I did like the part at the end where, at the workplace, Barbie prefers Flat Sandals over heels, I was relating all this to my pageant life, where wearing a minimum of 3.5 inches of heels was mandatory before stepping out of your room in public. In the movie, Barbie leaves the fake world behind.To end with my favourite line by Barbie's creator, Ruth Handler, played by Rhea Perlman: ""Humans have only one ending. Ideas live for ever."" The movie is a good introduction to the world of dolls for those who haven't seen anything like it before. It is a case study in itself, showing how the power of sentiment is a driving force in the doll industry. After a year of record sales during the epidemic, last year saw a dip, so it's easy to see why Mattel is counting on the new Barbie film to reverse the trend by syncing up with generation Z's pragmatic thinking.1 out of 5 found this helpful.

"Greta Gerwig did it. Broke the ceiling financially for a movie directed by a woman.I like all of her work and the Barbie theme was a daring one to take on. Then again she created a powerful version of Little Women. I also figured if Isa Rae agreed to be in this, there had to be more to it.It was so much funnier than expected. They figured out how to not make a parody of Barbie and Ken. That's no small task.I don't want to give away anything because everyone is going to see themselves in this in another way. It's clever, thoughtful, and so funny. The actors performed to perfection.There's a lot to unpack in this movie. I want to watch it again. It has all the makings of a classic and a cult film.10 out of 56 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie

It's cheesey AF at first.. if u can get past 15 mins of everyone saying the name Barbie, you will survive this movie. In the beginning they ""flip"" through past Barbies and I seen quite a few that used to own.. they also ""flash"" through some barbie clothes that will bring u right back to childhood. For nastalgia sake this movie will not disappoint... For new comer's sake, this movie will not disappoint! We counted the reasons why it's rated PG-13 and it's kinda hilarious.I hope there's a second movie... Barbie and The Rockers!!!!5 out of 17 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

Makes you laugh, cry, and ponder what it means to live in today's world.This film has a message for us all and makes some excellent philosophical points that will leave you thinking when the credits roll. It's that kind of movie. I was very pleasantly surprised to see that this movie didn't go the cartoony, campy direction. It so easily could have. But it went a much more thoughtful and clever way than I ever would've anticipated. I predict this movie becoming a classic, totally quotable movie, for years to come. Most of all I enjoyed myself at the movies again.3 out of 9 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Visually, it was a great movie to watch - colourful, cute and quirky. I enjoyed the first 20 - 30 minutes and then it went downhill from there. There's a lot of fantastic actors in it but I didn't go in with high expectations as I had no idea what to expect.For the story itself - sure, there were some morals and statements presented but it was a bit flat and a lot of the same. I left feeling totally underwhelmed. Gosling was great though. A few bits did make me laugh but it struggled to hold my attention. As sometimes happens, a lot of the funny parts were in the film trailers. I wouldn't watch it a second time through.1 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I expected this movie to be more lighthearted and it had heavy themes and material. The first half hour or so was ok and had some funny moments but the second half just wasn't enjoyable to me. The writing was not good story telling and felt more like a number of speeches. I found it hard to watch honestly.There was a lot of overt messaging that I feel was not suitable for this movie. I didn't appreciate the depiction of the relationship between Ken and Barbie or the situation created for them. The acting, some musical numbers and sets were good but overall a missed opportunity to make a fun feel-good movie. I was very disappointed.54 out of 85 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"First, lower your expectations and second, this is not a children's movie. Lastly, don't take it seriously.Go in with those three things in mind and if you have any sense of humor, you will really enjoy this film.It's honestly really dumb fun, along the lines of Anchorman or Talladega Nights. No, it's probably not as good as either of those, but is along the same comedic line and it is really funny and charming.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are both hysterical and do a great job in the movie. The entire theater laughed out loud through most of the movie. The supporting cast was spot on as well.There was a ton of reminiscing happening in the theater. You could hear countless women whispering ""I had that play set!"" Or ""I had that Barbie outfit."" That made the movie more enjoyable for many.Overall the movie was really good. In my opinion, the only misses were, every man in the movie was over the top stupid. No reason for that. And I believed the ending should have gone in a different direction, but I won't spoil it with my opinion.2 out of 6 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8,Barbie
"I was super excited for the movie since the day they announced it and I've been looking forward to it. I was ready with my pink shirt, popcorn and tickets to the early screening expecting a fun loving and very pink movie.And it sure was a very pink and fun loving movie, but I was not expecting the turn it took. It made me go through so many emotions I wasn't expecting to feel, twist and turns that made me laugh, moments that made me cry and the ending was fantastic to say the least.The Barbie Movie is everything I was expecting and so much more, I think the highlight, other than the amazing message, casting and storytelling, was when John Cena appeared.In summary, I'm not the same person I was 1h and 54m ago.10 out of 38 found this helpful.

"Up to 80% of the storyline the film was great and tapped into essential topics of personal development and gender identities, reflecting and criticising society. The cast and characters had flair in the right amount of depth and dimensionality as well as chemistry amongst them. Also great that by the time the choreographed dancing scene(s) came in, the viewer had gotten the chance to properly care about what had been building up and then, the songs had real impact. It made for some good fun and laughs.As for the remaining 20%, it felt the makers did not know how to tie everything up and went for a shallow symbolic move which was very blurry and loose.2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"My expectations were very low for the movie but I am surprised. The Movie was literally good, the cast were fantastic, the set up delivered the fabulousness of the B world! Margot Robbie is a great choice for Barbie. I hope to see some elements from lgbti+ but it did not bothered me at all. Planning to go and see again.Ryan Gosling, he literally delivered his best. The soundtrack should have some more elements from 80s 90s as the storyline mostly based on these years of Barbie.Paying a tribute to Ruth was amazing but they should have also pay a tribute to the original Barbie, Bild Lilli...30 out of 97 found this helpful.

"I really don't know what to say about this movie . Everything was colorful, the humor was there , the satire and everybody did great at what they were suppose to do . I went in there with low expectations because it's a Barbie film but I was surprised how adult the humor was and the message it got across was pretty touching . Margot Robbie as Barbie was perfect casting and the theatre was filled , everybody had a good time . I should give this score maybe a bit higher but I just felt it was just a bunch of things mashed together I was watching a parody episode of South Park which is not a bad thing , I though it was the right direction for a movie called Barbie . It was weird to me but in a very good way and LOL at the ending , made everybody laugh . Check it out , I say it's worth a view in the theatre.0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"This movie was definitely made for everybody. It had hilarious scenes and a few sad ones. And I was always told when a movie makes you laugh and cry, it's a great movie. The plot and message was unexpected, in a good way though. I could also tell that it touched people. In the theatre, I heard "" oh my god,"", sniffles, and gasps. The cast and acting was off the top and the detail was, too. Although, you may here some comments saying, "" Oh this movie is sexist against men,"". You really have to see the movie to understand it. The people that are saying those things, obviously have not seen the movie. It's just so good, I would be able to watch this everyday. It is definitely worth the money to see it.30 out of 102 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Welcome back, Streamers! The most anticipated movie weekend of 2023 is here. It's Barbenheimer. If you haven't followed it, there's this ridiculous internet debate over which film will reign supreme between Greta Gerwig's Barbie and Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer...In this corner, coming in at 11.5 inches, it's the iconic, blonde fashion doll, Barbie.Barbie is the first live-action film about the American icon and her place in culture. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach wrote a screenplay, which Gerwig directs, that takes audiences into Barbieland, where we meet stereotypical Barbie (Marot Robbie) and her fellow Barbies living their perfect existences until one day stereotypical Barbie starts to think constantly about death, her feet become flat and other things are off. Barbie has to make a trek to the real world to find out why things have changed for her and to set them straight. Barbie is accompanied by Ken (Ryan Gosling), whose existence is so dependent upon Barbie that he only has a good day if Barbie looks at him. Rollerblading, hot pink singing and dancing hijinks ensue.Overall, Barbie is a weird and wonderful movie. It is clear that a lot of thought and money went into creating this story and world inhabited by Barbie. You will be awed by the clever production design and the intense attention to detail that went into constructing Barbieland. The colors pop. There are cute animated touches throughout. Additionally, the costume design enhances each Barbie and Ken in interesting ways. You'll also notice the music throughout the film is sometimes poignant and sometimes hilarious, especially when it involves the Kens. From top to bottom, the crafts in this movie are top notch and worthy of a trip to the big screen.The cast, especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, are excellent. Robbie brings sensitivity and heart to Barbie. She's thoughtful and kind while also being naive and troubled by her own existence. It is a tricky performance to pull off and Robbie is great. Ken is an iconic performance for Gosling. He pulls out all of the stops to bring Ken to life. I can't imagine another actor being as successful in this role. Gosling is a really gifted comedic actor as evidenced by this performance. I'll also note that Kate McKinnon, American Ferrar, Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Michael Cera and Issa Rae each have good moments as well. It's a big cast, but some of the smaller roles do get chances to shine.The main issue is that the messaging is so heavy-handed. There is a lot to unpack about Barbie's place in society. What does she represent to women and girls? What does she represent to men? There are themes of feminism, patriarchy, and corporate greed. The film does its best to address its issues in a clever and subversive way, but it veers into becoming patronizing at times rather than funny and satirical. The performances of the actors really carry the film across the finish line despite how it handles its themes.Ultimately, Barbie is a movie worthy of a trip to the theater. It is funny and even clever at times. The messaging of the movie gets heavy-handed and some of the subversive fun is lost in those moments. Nevertheless, Gosling and Robbie fully commit to their characters as does the large ensemble; and the production design and music are top notch. You won't be disappointed with a big box of popcorn. You decide if you want to wear hot pink like everyone else.0 out of 9 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8,Barbie
"Greta Gerwig, took the most famous doll of humanity, a luxury cast and made a good film with an important message!Barbie offers almost 120 minutes of fun, captivating and fluid moments. Mixing real elements with ""drawn"" scenarios, it manages to bring the two worlds together in a balanced and intelligent way, varying between ""cartoons"" and the real world.It also shows in a very intelligent way all the difficulties that women go through in their lives, such as the lack of respect for their intellectual and physical property, as well as illustrating a series of moments that illustrate patriarchy and the disrespectful way in which many men treat women and think they are superior based on their gender. A message that Ryan Gosling had in a great performance to emphasize the perspective that unfortunately still reigns in many men today.Speaking of the cast, Ryan Gosling had a script that favored him, with several scenes and different roles that allowed him to show all his versatility as an actor, and the reality is that he delivered a high-level performance, the best in the film imo, and that he managed not only to give strength to the message that he wanted to convey, but also to elevate the film to another level with his musical performances. On the other hand, imo, Margot had a script that didn't exploit all of his acting skills. Don't get me wrong, her acting is very good, within what was provided, the performance is very good, however I think the script could have given her more, due to the versatility she has!And my first negative point is precisely that. The script was too attached to the message it wanted to convey and did not use all the potential that ""Barbie"" provided, such as the affective side and its overall positive impact on many women. Furthermore, the focus on the concept limited the development of characters and a cast that had more to offer!The dialogues also suffer from a lot of fluctuations, the good dialogues are really good but seem very disconnected from the rest, as the construction even them felt lazy. It's as if they didn't connect to what just happened in the last few minutes and just came out of nowhere. It's a shame, because there are really good speeches!Finally, the message got across clearly and the most important thing is clearly retained. This movie was never about pink or a doll. It was about women and the rights they are due! Respect, freedom, and justice in relation to the opportunities they should have. Doors should open according to the work carried out and the skills demonstrated, never to the gender or color of a person! Love is love no matters what. Respect is to everyone, there's no ""but""! However, I think Greta missed an incredible opportunity to make a stronger ""statement"" about equal rights, duties and opportunities for all!In short, it's a good film, light, funny and entertaining, and can be watched several times as something to ""pass the time and have fun"" but should be watched, at least once, in a serious and dedicated way for all the message it has!3 out of 15 found this helpful.

"I really wanted to like the movie, and I totally enjoyed the first third of it, until it turned into a lecture on patriarchy. Women are portrayed as infinitely oppressed people who can't do anything except for crying about their existence.Don't get me wrong, I expected it to be about feminism and empowerment, but not that awfully straightforward about it.I could've been a great movie. A 10 movie, but it feels like the authors just hate men so much, they can't think of anything else.I also feel sorry for all female executives at Mattel. The board of directors is portrayed as oppressively male-only, to maintain the narrative.To sum up, you gonna love it if you want to feel sad and oppressed about being a woman. Not so much if you just like Barbies and want to have a good time.8 out of 10 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",5,Barbie
"I went into this film opening day for a good laugh not expecting too much from it. When I exited the theatre I was shocked by how good of a film it was. I didn't expect it to be so funny, so we'll written, I just thought it would be okay and a bit cheesy but no. Truly a great film but there are a few jokes that might go over young kids heads, as well as some of the references. One of the most fun films of the year to experience, especially if you are depressed after watching 'Oppenheimer'. It has moments of sadness, laughs and so much more. Overall 10, great message, great acting, great movie.5 out of 21 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"I anticipated this movie long before it came out and already watched it twice in the cinema. Greta Gerwig managed to make our wildest Barbie-dreams come true and not only created some of the funniest comedy i've seen in a long time in a movie, but also made me agree so hard with every feminist message she put in the film. Messages that everyone needs to hear - even, or should i say, especially men.The performances where wonderful, particularly that of Ryan Gosling who really tapped into his Kenergy. I thought it was interesting to see that not only Barbie aka Margo Robbie got a character arc, where she got to grow up to become a woman. Also Ken aka Ryan Gosling underwent some significant character growth that I much appreciated.As the trailer said; If you love Barbie, you will love this film. If you hate Barbie, you will still love this film. Because it isn't only about a doll, but also about the patriarchal system we all have to deal with on a daily basis and about the complexity that is human life in general. Who would have thought a movie about Barbie could do such things?10 out of 24 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"I took my twin daughters to go see this film at the movie theaters with me this weekend. They are 11 and they seemed to enjoy it. The film is geared much to a older crowd, which helped keep them entertained as well as the adults that were in the theater as well. Margot Robbie was great as Barbie she did very good in that role. I love how the film put a modern twist on how people are these days in society- dealing with social anxiety and other disorders. Yet it tells the story of why Barbie was initially invented to began with and what Barbie and Ken stood for. This is a good film to watch with your teenage daughters.0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"This is the best movie I've seen in last 5 years. It's fun from beginning till the end. It is just what you would expect from a barbie movie, but it's also so much more. The plot is excellent, there is a lot of cool cameos and there is a new surprise in every second of the movie. It's unpredictable, so funny and it's also kind of deep.

"Barbie is a film that on the outside appeals to a younger audience but it is certainly much more mature in overall nature.Barbie pushes the boundaries of what a people blindly may assume a Barbie movie should or would be able to- in both good ways, and bad ways.The good- Barbie is at many moments, fun, adaptive, emotional, even philosophically provoking. The story is enjoyable and attention-grabbing while both Gosling and Robbie have played their roles to a T. Margot Robbie played the ""stereotypical Barbie"" so well, almost too well at times. Ryan Gosling played Ken so well and the contrast between him in two different arcs of the film were not only distinct but all-believable. The costume design was superb and I was thoroughly impressed with some of the visuals and set design throughout. The CGI is very poor at a few scenes (which normally I would put under cons) BUT the film doesn't take its self too seriously during those scenes, so it's rather comical than anything.The bad- The writing of this film contains certain elements of contradiction; It essentially claims that women can (mostly) only be powerful by holding ""high societal job responsibilities,"" such as being a lawyer, doctor, president, etc; when this just simply isn't true, MOTHERS FOR EXAMPLE! Being a mother is one of (if not the biggest) responsibility a human can have- the idea of a collective job that can single handedly shift an entire generations thinking? Yeah, sorry but mother's are the most powerful. The film at several moments gets very political but subliminally and not-subliminally, which is always annoying no matter what political beliefs you carry, it's just almost always cringe I guess?TLDR; ""Barbie"" triumphs in being fun, engaging, and thought-provoking. The film, like many others, sells itself short by its political agenda and removes depth by doing so. Overall a mostly enjoyable experience meant for an adult audience.7.3.0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7,Barbie
"I may not have played with Barbie dolls and fairly no interest in this from a subject standpoint, but I have to say this movie rocks. Margot Robbie is awesome, Gerwig's direction is solid, the writing is well thought out, the colors pop, and let's not forget how amazing Ryan Gosling is in this. His Ken will go down in history as one of his best roles, calling it now. I do wish there were things that were more utilized in the film, especially Venice Beach as a location. It felt really shoe horned into the plot. Also some of the side characters just really didn't need to be there. But overall, this picture really works because it's messaging about the hardships of the modern woman is spot on. Also I liked how they actually critiqued Mattel at times for making a doll with insane beauty standards for young children. I'm definitely looking forward to see where Gerwig takes her career after this because this is truly a box office and critical smash that can lead to some interesting projects in the future.1 out of 13 found this helpful.

"As soon as the first teaser trailer dropped on YouTube for Barbie, it captured my attention and admiration for it recreated the ""Dawn of Men"" sequence from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey in a very creative and classic way. The hype of that one minute long clip, featuring (my celebrity crush) Margot Robbie who steals the show no matter what movie or role she is in, had me believing that this movie would be phenomenal. And over the course of several months until today, my expectations for this movie got bigger and bigger. This is partly thanks to the Barbenheimer online phenomenon which I followed and watched the both movies on the same opening day.Honestly, I didn't get everything I expected and I cannot say what I got is better than what I had expected. However, 2 hours of my time in front of that huge screen was pretty fun because Barbie is simply a very fun movie to watch and I absolutely loved it. I believe this is thanks to the feeling of watching it on the big screen with a bunch of strangers around to laugh with. I will definitely watch the movie again upon the digital release to try to prove myself wrong.Margot Robbie is, as always, phenomenal in the movie. Her incredible talent and charm carries almost the entire film, not to mention that she is a co-producer. She is not the best casting choice to play a Barbie doll but in this particular Barbie movie, she was born for the role. Her co-star Ryan Gosling is the comedic heart of the movie. Without him, the movie would certainly not be as fun as it is. The rest of the cast also compliment their roles fairly well, playing iconic characters and dolls of different races and sizes.I was expecting a longer, a more serious and elaborate plot for Barbie but what I got instead is not too bad. The movie clearly carries a message and that message is clearly conveyed through a plot that is brief and basically easy to understand which is built up in a favorable way.The production design and the costume design is certainly a huge part of the film. All the costumes, sets, props and everything look and feel so compelling and, most important of all, accurate to the overall history and legacy of Barbie and Mattel. I hugely respect that attention to detail.At the end of the day, Barbie is a movie I have been impatiently waiting for a long time and that I feel honored to have seen today on the opening day. It is a beautiful work of art paying beautiful homage to the legacy of it's origins and I am happy that I started loving this movie way before its release . . .2 out of 22 found this helpful.

"The movie started on the light side and fun, but the longer it went on the more preachy it became. It seemed the movie could not make up its mind if it was going to be a light and a fun movie or a heavy teaching a life lesson movie. This gives the viewer a roller coaster type viewing, where you are laughing a little (not a lot), but then the movie goes into a long, life lesson on how men are bad, and not very smart, but somehow they run the real world. Women are the real smart ones and the real world needs to change to match Barbie world. This changes the whole movie from just a fun time to head beating lesson, which takes a lot of the fun out of it. Too bad.13 out of 19 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Oh my goodness, where do I even begin with ""Barbie"" (2023)? This film is an absolute delight and a true masterpiece that will leave you in awe. Directed by the incredibly talented Greta Gerwig and starring the stunning Margot Robbie as the iconic doll herself, ""Barbie"" is a cinematic experience like no other.From start to finish, ""Barbie"" captivates audiences with its seamless blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. Gerwig's direction is nothing short of brilliant as she brings the world of Barbie to life with a perfect balance of humor and depth. The humor, in particular, is off the charts hilarious, with giant laugh-out-loud moments that had me clutching my sides. It's remarkable how the humor appeals to viewers of all ages, making it one of the funniest movies of the year.But what truly sets ""Barbie"" apart is its profound and thought-provoking narrative. The film revolves around Barbie's existential crisis and her quest to find meaning in her existence. This exploration of Barbie's identity as a feminist symbol is incredibly compelling and challenges societal norms and expectations surrounding femininity and girlhood. Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals? This deep, existential question lingers long after the credits roll, prompting introspection and discussion.Margot Robbie's performance as Barbie is nothing short of extraordinary. She brings a charisma and depth to the character that is truly captivating. Watching her journey of self-discovery unfold on screen is an absolute joy. And let's not forget Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken, which complements Robbie's Barbie perfectly. Their on-screen chemistry is off the charts and adds another layer of excitement to the film.I should mention that ""Barbie"" has received widespread acclaim from both critics and audiences, and it's easy to see why. It strikes a perfect balance between appealing to longtime fans and captivating new audiences. The movie's mass appeal transcends age, gender, and previous Barbie doll opinions, making it a delightful and engaging experience for viewers of all backgrounds.Despite its PG-13 rating, ""Barbie"" remains family-friendly and suitable for teenagers and older kids. The clever marketing of the film ensures that it appeals to a wide range of audiences, making it a perfect choice for family movie nights.In conclusion, ""Barbie"" is an absolute triumph in every aspect of filmmaking. With its stellar cast, innovative approach, brilliant humor, and profound exploration of societal themes, it more than deserves a perfect 10 rating. This cinematic gem is a must-watch for anyone seeking an enchanting and thought-provoking experience that transcends the boundaries of age and nostalgia. Brace yourself to be dazzled and captivated by the delightful world of ""Barbie."" Trust me, you won't be disappointed!0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"There was a lot of hype leading up to this movie, because of the cast and simply because it's a movie about Barbie. This movie 100% backed up it's hype. This was a very funny movie with a great storyline. I am going to be honest, I was not expecting it to be that good of a storyline and it truly was.It was a weirdly funny movie that also had good morals and a great message behind it. Ryan Gosling stole the show and cracked up the audience basically every-time he appeared on the screen (along with Will Ferrell of course) Margot Robbie did a phenomenal job as Barbie. Overall it was an amazing watch and no reason this movie should receive any hate!2 out of 14 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9,Barbie
"Not just the intro, but the whole movie is funny and smart as hell. You are griped by the voice of Helen Mirren, interactive singing by Liso and a strong focus on humor. The details in Barbieland are hilarious. There is no water in the shower or glasses, the pool is a decoration, every night is a girl's night. It shows you how great imagination is, especially kids imagination. And it guides you to perceive the movie with an open mind. After Barbie and Ken enter the real world, it can be even more unhinged and crazy than Barbieland. What helps you to just go with it, is that this 'real world' is also shown as fiction, in details. The all the way up button in the elevator, the immediate response of the director of Mattel, that they had to get Barbie in the box, meeting the ghost of an old lady. It really helps you to let that absurd concept entertain you on every level. So you laugh a lot, cry a bit, feel motivated and you hope that everyone is truly listening to the message to love yourself.0 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I say this without a shred of irony; Greta Gerwig's Barbie is undoubtedly the film we so desperately need right now. This is the movie of our time - a film that shows us what life and society are like now, as well as shows us how we can do better. Plus, the movie is pure joy! It's a perfect mix of existentialism, heartfelt and important social-commentary and unapologetic silliness. This is the most fun I've had at a movie in a long time - and yet thanks to Gerwig's incredible script it also manages to be very a profound exploration of feminism, existentialism, the patriarchy, and masculinity all packaged in a satirical musical comedy homage to the fabric of cinema.This movie is so hard for me to review... because it's just SO GOOD! Like oh my god go see it right now, it's incredible, important, and so much fun! Genuinely, it's the most fun I've had at a movie in a long time - it's filled with pure joy and hope! Barbie exceeded all my expectations and completely lives up to the hype surrounding it! Honestly, it's pretty much a perfect film! I had a freaking blast with the movie - I loved everything it did! It's pretty much the funnest movie ever!As I write this review and reflect on the film, I had the sudden urge to revisit Greta Gerwig's breakout directorial effort; Lady Bird, and was struck by how strong and unique a voice Gerwig has as a filmmaker. Having seen her take on Little Women and now Barbie, I can easily say she is one of the most interesting and talented filmmakers working today! I'm super impressed with Gerwig as a filmmaker - all her movies are completely different and she has avoided being placed in a box. The film industry wants you to do what they know you can do very well - it wants to place filmmakers in a box, labeling someone as only a horror filmmaker, another who only does comedies, etc. Because of her ability to do LOTS of different things very well, she has been able to avoid being labeled as only one thing, making her one of the most interesting filmmakers working today. She has shown herself to be very versatile - truly on the level of Spielberg. She's easily one of the greatest of her generation. I also really love how she isn't afraid to tackle complex social issues in her films, and she somehow always manages to find really profound and interesting ways to communicate her messages. She blends social commentary with story to the point that a scene can be both emotional and profound while also hilarious and entertaining at the same time! Gerwig is also a very economical, smart storyteller - every shot, action, and line of dialogue tells us something about character or story, nothing is wasted! Plus, Gerwig seems to be endlessly creative and really commits to her visions. I've become a huge fan of Gerwig's work and Barbie has just solidified my love for her as a filmmaker!Greta Gerwig's work in Barbie is the literal definition of innovative and insightful direction with an actual authentic voice and vision to back it up. If the movie is honoured, she better come along with it. It all starts with her, and in anyone else's hands, it all falls flat. What could've been a soulless, superficial cash grab becomes something so singular, subversive, and stirring. No one could make this movie like her. She IS the movie.The secret weapon of Barbie is that magic ability Gerwig has as a writer and director to strike such a perfect balance between message and entertainment, which is something that is incredibly hard to do! Don't expect this film to be just another toy brand adaptation like the Transformers films, this is not forgettable, mindless entertainment. Barbie is trying to teach us something and has lessons that people need to hear. The commentary isn't heavy-handed or forced at all, it feels natural and, in fact, the way they comment on gender roles, masculinity and femininity, and the stereotypes of those is a lot of fun while also making you think! Like the best comedies, it is able to layer in commentary to all of the humour - the film has a really healthy sense of humour for all the themes it is exploring! I just absolutely love that in a given scene I could be laughing so hard, and yet also really engaging with the thematic and emotional material in that same scene to the extent that I did. Scenes would be both really funny and yet deep and insightful at the same time; it's very rare a film with this strong a message is this entertaining! My god Greta Gerwig is a master! Even the humour was so well done - it was so unexpected and willing to do anything! I loved it! It was a combination of both high and low-brow humour; I loved the goofiness and the slapstick elements to it, but also really loved that it managed to balance this over-the-top humour with really clever wordplay and more subtle, dryly delivered dialogue! And the fact it never took away from the seriousness or importance of a scene was just stunning to me! You can really tell Gerwig and Noah Baumbach had a lot of fun writing this one - and I'm amazed Mattel and Warner Bros allowed them to get away with some of the things they did!Though Barbie is largely silly and satirical (and yes, a ""studio movie""), there are so many moments where Greta Gerwig's singular style shines and it takes your breath away - one of the most unforgettable moments in the film is Barbie on the bench, experiencing every human emotion for the first time. (You'll know it when you see it.) I think scenes like this show that, while Barbie does have a lot to say about womanhood and coming-of-age as a woman in a complicated and contradictory world, it's ultimately just as much about what it means to be alive and be a human in general. And no one is excluded from that. (Men, I'm looking at you.)I know a lot of guys might not think they are part of the target audience for the film. But trust me, I'm a guy, and I LOVED it. I connected with so many of the themes and loved getting to see my girlfriend connect with even more of them. This movie is for everyone. Sure, women will identify with it in some areas a lot more than others will, but there is much to offer for everyone else. This movie is a film everyone needs to see, and everyone would enjoy it if they gave it a chance! Trust me, go in with an open mind and I promise you won't be disappointed.The film tells a really moving story about what it means to be a woman in today's world, and you really don't have to be a woman to be moved by it! The screenplay and themes are so well done and get better and better as the film goes on as the deeper layers begin to reveal themselves. It's truly beautiful and so heartfelt - there is so much love in this movie for women and mothers! And really when it comes down to it, this is pretty much a story about finding yourself. It's about gender roles in society and the societal construct and expression of those roles. It's about how we cope and exist with models, role models, and other influences in society. It's a breakdown of Barbie (the doll) - what she did for the world that was both good and bad, and how she could possibly help it moving forward. Gerwig wasn't afraid to rip apart the way in which Barbie is an outdated concept and represents the worst of what we think gender means, such as how it has negatively influenced body image standards for women. Gerwig also ponders the extent that the legacy of Barbie has contributed to or detracted from feminist movements - has Barbie empowered women or instead created outdated stereotypes? Greta Gerwig almost did too good of a job for Mattel! I can't believe Mattel agreed to this, it very much critiques them and Barbie at times. It's just such a smart movie and manages to cover all these topics and themes in such a natural and entertaining way without ever feeling forced!And oh my god! America Ferrera has such a powerful monologue in the film about how women have to try to navigate society and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I saw the film. It's one of the most profound pieces of writing I've seen in quite a while and it's delivered beautifully. Probably the part of the movie that's stuck with me the most since watching it. It's sending an important message to the audience while also allowing the film's narrative to move forward smoothly and efficiently. And I can't even imagine how much it will mean to all the women and girls who see the film - I know it really meant a lot to my girlfriend and has allowed many women to feel seen! America Ferrera is the film's beating heart and luminous soul, she gives such a genuinely moving performance and a show-stopping monologue that had the audience applauding. No one can write a monologue like Greta Gerwig!As I said, the film meant a lot to my girlfriend, and I wanted to include these thoughts she had after we saw it, as I think it really shows how truly important the message of this film is:""Barbie is a movie about growing up and realizing womanhood isn't all pink, pleasure, and possibility. Realizing that much of the world will hate you - always - no matter what you do, simply because of who you are. Realizing that there comes a point when you either have to accept complacency within the patriarchy, or ostracization and vilification outside of it.Or, maybe there's another way. Maybe womanhood isn't all the fun and freedom dreamed up in youth, but maybe we don't have to abandon it entirely either. Maybe, just maybe, once we accept and begrudgingly embrace the often brutal reality of our everyday existence - while still retaining our inner strength at the same time - we can better reconcile all these cultural complications and contradictions and find a way to move through the world cautiously, but authentically. Revelling in our - and the world's - flaws instead of willfully overlooking them in favour of the fantasy.0 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Absolutely AMAZING!!!!I do not know how it is possible but the Barbie movie exceeded my expectations and then some!!! It was sooooo dang hilarious!!!I love the silliness, aesthetics and nostalgia of it all plus the laughs just kept on coming. Of course they had to build a story so there were a few long monologues but there were soooo many laugh out loud moments throughout the whole movie.Also, Lets talk about Ryan Gosling...Who knew he was so funny.. He killed it as Ken! I was not expecting him to be so good. I will definitely be going back to the movies to watch it again...Oh yeah, BTW Its DEFINITELY PG-13 so I wouldn't bring the kids..26 out of 86 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Wow, this was really bad. Here is the truth. It's boring. Plus, who wants to here about the patriarchy for 2hrs. Yes, the word patriarchy is said like 100 times. It's crazy. This was so heavy handed I don't even get why woman would like it....ithis should be fun, not some political statement. Let me tell you, the only fun was in the first 30 mins. Nobody, and I mean Nobody was laughing. The plot is all over the place and kind of surprising from the actual writer, which has done some great work in the past. Just makes me wonder if she was forced to push all this political stuff by corporate or she actually believes this nonsense. I thought Barbie would just be a fun goofy movie. But to be preached for 2 hours????? What the hell. I'm telling you most people will not like this movie, unless you're far far left.30 out of 46 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"This movie was so much lively and joyful. Also filled a lot of pink It was so amazing. It's like dream worldSometimes movies that make us happy and hopeful about life are really required a lot in order to survive in this depressing worldThis movie is a literally a portal towards happiness, to escape sadness for whileThank you Greta Gerwig for directing such an amazing movie Really appreciated Ready to see more of your amazing workAnd let me tell all of you that this movie doesn't represent anything This is just a normal movie that should be enjoyed Pls don't judge and make anything out of thisAnd this doesn't support wokeism in any way And pls don't compare this movie to Oppenheimer Both movies are from a complete different genreGreta Gerwig cannot be compared to Christopher Nolan in any way She tried very hard and her work was good Hats offIf you ask me Barbie or Oppenheimer Obviously my answer is OppenheimerOppenheimer is one of the best movies of this century And the best movie of the yearSo Oppenheimer is the best movie But Barbie is also good movieHence we shouldn't fight over it And watch both.18 out of 68 found this helpful.

Being a huge barbie fan I had to go watch this movie and let me tell you it did not disappoint. Started as a fun kids movie but took a. Wry interesting turn with its story line.The display of patriarchy in real world using barbie land was so smartly done.A great direction with attention to details that makes this so much fun to watch.Some of the moments will make you burst out laughing and some will make you really emotional.It's a movie for every age group but absolutely a must watch for teenagers.My fiancé watched it with me who doesn't know anything about barbies but has a wonderful time. He rated it 8 so that's quite a lot.Enjoy.3 out of 12 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink,1,Barbie
"The latest installment in the Barbie movie franchise takes an unexpected turn, veering away from the child-friendly themes that fans have come to expect. In this new adventure, Barbie finds herself navigating the complexities of the real world, facing a stark realisation that men rule the world - much to Ken's delight.While this plotline may spark debate and offer an occasion for intellectual discourse, it's crucial to remember the intended audience of such movies. Given its 12A certificate, this film should not be regarded as a children's movie. Parents expecting lighthearted entertainment may be caught off-guard when sitting down with their young ones.For those who are able to appreciate its more mature themes and humour, moments of levity can be found. However, with a slow beginning that only picks up halfway through, some viewers may struggle to maintain interest. Furthermore, the film's rushed conclusion leaves much to be desired and falls short in satisfying fans' craving for a cohesive storyline.Potential audience members should weigh whether the departure from traditional child-oriented content is worth viewing or not.In summary, while this unique approach to a Barbie movie has its merits, it should be approached with caution by parents of younger children due to its mature themes and occasional tedium.1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"Barbie, the movie is great! It stars Margot Robbie as the character Barbie! There's also some so many starring actors/actresses who are also in that movie who they are fictitious! This movie is great for all viewers to watch, including millions people across the nation worldwide! The movie is a comedy, live action, and funny! Margot Robbie is an inspiring actress known for her movies, such as I, Tonya, About Time, and so much more! This movie is an inspiration for people who want to watch and see! Viewers who want to watch this movie watch it anywhere, anytime! Thank you, and have a nice day!!3 out of 12 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"This movie was just so fun to watch. I'm not personally a fan of barbie, never really played with them or interacted with the IP in anyway, but just the pure outlandish absurdity of this movie and the over-the-top acting... I couldn't stop laughing throughout most of the runtime.Based on how the movie was marketed, I was 100% expecting to be pondering the question, ""what does it mean to exist?"" by the end. Well, the movie pondered the question, came to a conclusion, and then told me what that conclusion was in a way that was very clear and easy to understand. Personally, I like when a movie isn't exactly clear. I like when I have to dig a little, think about it, discuss it with other people. With Barbie, I felt no need for that. The message was crystal clear. I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing, but it was just a little too on the nose for my taste.All in all, a super fun watch. I saw this with my family. We bought popcorn, milkshakes, and it was a great time.4 out of 27 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7,Barbie
"Laugh out loud humor, fantastic sets and costumes that contain a wonderful message. I took my teenage daughter and preteen son and we all were incredibly surprised by exactly how much we enjoyed the entire film. I was not sure what to expect but it exceeded anything I could have imagined. While there was an inherently difficult topic at the core, it was handled delicately and with care. Lots of hilarity for the adults but minimal issues that would create discomfort if you take younger kids. My kids have already said they want to watch it again. So do I because I think I will find deeper concepts on a 2nd watch. And the music was phenomenal!10 out of 35 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Underneath the corporate irony and plate-spinning, there's a film that is mildly humorous; if not a tad lost with it's identity and message. A battle between feminism and stereotyping. Is this a film for young girls? I don't know, it feels as if it's wondered off the reservation. Is it a film for women - more than likely. There's heartfelt messaging at the curtain closing, but it very much straddles the fence between traditional conservative womanhood and progressive girl boss ""smash the patriarchy"".Speaking of patriarchy, this film drops the p-word countless times. And the image of masculinity is confusing, is Ken masculine or campy and confused? Horse obsessed, gym bro, with a passion for theatrics and fur coats - traditional masculine, doubtful.I don't know who this film was made for, or where it stands on anything. The safe corporate mediocre middle ground is where this film stakes it's claim for your attention and money.Enjoy it by all means, if you can straighten out it's allegorical message, then please let me know.18 out of 26 found this helpful.

"Come on Barbie, let's go smash the patriarchy!Greta Gerwig is the freaking best!! Looking at all the one/two stars reviews written by obviously male audience (or males who haven't watched it, just wanna express their fragile and insecure masculinity) makes this film even more ironic and a mirror of our society. Brava, Gerwig!Must take your boyfriends, straight male friends, brothers to watch this film, a good way to educate them or you know, get the hell out of the relationship while you still can.It's not just a simple film anymore, it's a sensational experience, a work of new generation. Maybe it's not perfect, but we need this, the society need this, the straight white male dominated Hollywood absolutely need this.9 out of 31 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I can only recommend to see this joyful movie with an incredible cast.If you like fun, creativity, colors and a great plot that is both entertaining and thoughtful this is one of the best movies you can see.Songs are OK but choreographies are amazing. Everything in the movie is weird but in the best sense because it is unlike any other movie. Ryan Gosling plays both a brilliant regular guy and kinda stupid at the same time, which is super cute and sensitive. While the movie is full of intentional stupidity and fun, it makes us man rethink manhood, not really because of the feminist discourse - which is a bit too much present here - but in more subtile way because of Gosling's character reactions and evolution throughout the movie.It is also a movie about American culture at its best : Barbieland is a reflection of America and vice-versa. The plot nourishes itself brilliantly from that reflection and challenges both men and women's conception of our dreams. Consumerism, business, idealism, self deprecative humour, all ingredients are there. The only downside we can find to this movie is the labyrinth style plot that is too stretched sometimes and unnecessary. More importantly this makes it unsuitable for younger audience. Thank you Mattel for this piece of fun !!6 out of 46 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9,Barbie
"Basically a Mattel remake of Heaven Can Wait: A person travels to a separate 'reality' to better understand who they are and what they have to offer in this world, and how the two worlds are connected. Add to it the fun movie opening rip off of 2001 Space Odyssey, it's hard to say that this is a very original movie. However, Margot Robbie brings it home and grounds the emotional side of the movie beautifully. The colour palette and the messages are worthwhile, ballsy directing and old for this role but excellent Gosling make it worth seeing. Will we remember this movie few years from now? No. But doesn't mean it's not worth seeing.0 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7,Barbie
"Barbie directed by Greta Gerwig introduces us to Stereotypical Barbie played by Margot Robbie having yet another perfect day in Barbieland an utopia where all its inhabitants are dolls, living in their pink dreamhouses with no exterior walls. Each day in Barbieland is a perfect day. However one day Barbie shows signs of being a human and is asked to go to Barbieland to figure out who's playing with her and fix everything. Along the way she discovers the joys and perils of living amongst humans and where she's truly meant to be.In this day and age when a lot of the movies rely on being ultra realistic and dark Barbie comes off as a surprise. It's escapism from reality and lots of entertainment is what audiences are craving right now. Barbie is such a fun and gorgeous movie that is filled with humour, heart, emotions and a lot of good messages. The production design and costumes are fantastic to look at and are absolute eye candies. The story is about self discovery and the evaluation of life however some might be caught off guard with the risks that Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach take with thier storytelling and social commentary.Speaking of the performances, Margot Robbie is perfect as Stereotypical Barbie but its Ryan Gosling's Ken that shines the most. He provides most of the comedic relief and is absolutely hilarious. The rest of cast does a pretty good job. Plus the monologue given by America Ferrera is something that everybody should listen to. It's so touching and talks about the challenges a woman has to go through in the society.Overall Barbie is a vibrant, bold and delightful movie that is fuelled by its star studded cast and flawlessly incorporated humour and though some of the creative choices might not always stick the landing, the good stuff largely overpowers the bad ones to create an immersive experience for the audience. Greta Gerwig has done it yet again.1 out of 8 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9,Barbie
"Barbie can offer genuine fun when enjoyed with a partner and a carefree attitude, but I strongly advise against watching it in the cinema. The movie lacks the expected nostalgia that a Barbie film should evoke, and it is riddled with hypocrisy and statements that don't hold true within the storyline.At its best, the movie is decent. The acting overral is commendable, especially with Margot Robbie delivering a great performance and being a good fit for her role. Some scenes are enjoyable and endearing, capable of eliciting laughter and providing a good time, but they don't leave a lasting impact. The soundtrack, from my perspective, was consistently great throughout the film with just a couple odd choices.However, my main issue with the movie lies in its overt push of social and political views onto the audience. Instead of letting the viewers interpret the themes on their own, the film explicitly spells out its messages, which can be off-putting. The movie seems too focused on trying to please every audience, resulting in a predictable Hollywood cliché.Moreover, it appears that the film fails to cater to two significant demographics. Younger viewers might struggle to follow the movie and comprehend its messages, leaving them disconnected and confused. On the other hand, older audiences, who would have been the main target for nostalgic appeal, may find this aspect lacking in the film, missing an opportunity to connect on a deeper level.In summary, while Barbie can be enjoyable when approached with the right mindset and company, the movie falls short of meeting expectations. The strong performances and some fun moments are marred by heavy-handed messaging and a failure to deliver the nostalgia that fans were hoping for.0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"Barbie is a beautifully heart-warming extravaganza for both boys and girls alike. A gloriously pink, joy-filled experience that I can't wait to go and see again. From the wonderful set design and perfect casting to the brilliant soundtrack and story to match, there is something for everyone to enjoy.I can't pay more respect to the cast, Margot Robbie as stereotypical Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken are the obvious standouts, they certainly delivered on the hype - but I was pleasantly surprised by Will Ferrell's short but hilarious moments on screen as well as Michael Cera as Alan (a true unsung hero).As mentioned, the set design is really quite stunning. Gazing upon Barbie land in all it's pink glory is pure joy, there is no doubt the set design is one of the films greatest strengths. But Barbie doesn't just look great, it sounds great with its vibrant collection of tracks and performances (including Ryan Gosling and his guitar).Barbie wraps up all the fun and colour with a solid story and strong positive message that fits perfectly in the world Greta Gerwig created. Of course some people may not enjoy the social commentary that pervades Barbie but I believe Greta Gerwig laid out the foundations for such a message perfectly, empowering girls and boys of all ages.Barbie feels like a must see movie, it built the hype and then delivered exceptionally. If you haven't been tempted yet you're missing out on all the fun that this beautiful movie has to offer.5 out of 22 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"I am a big fan of the actress Margot Robbie. I loved her last year in ""Babylon"" and ""Amsterdam"". And before those I loved her in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and as Harley Quinn in ""Suicide Squad"", ""Birds of Prey"" and ""The Suicide Squad"".I also liked Ryan Gosling in ""La la land"".Now here they are together in ""Barbie"" directed by Greta Gerwig, who did such a great job with ""Little Women"" and ""Lady Bird"".I didn't know what to expect from a movie about a Barbie doll but this movie is a very entertaining and fun movie that brings Barbie's world to life with great production design and costumes and good cinematography.I couldn't imagine another actress playing this part as perfectly as Margot Robbie does here. She is a great movie star. The supporting cast is also excellent including Will Ferrell as the CEO of Mattel. I had a great time with the movie ""Barbie"".3 out of 34 found this helpful.

"Barbie was certainly unique. It has a simple plot which well fits its target youth audience, it does have moments of comedy but don't expect any other sorts of genres. Both Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie give a good performance which is convincing at times but not always. Greta Gerwig sometimes shows reasonably interesting and unique cinematography however most of the shots and music are predictable. This movie was packed with a star studded cast which lives it up to a greater name than it deserves. If you have young children they will certainly enjoy it, but if not I wouldn't recommend it to you.0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6,Barbie
"This was perfectly cast. I mean Ryan Gosling as Ken (I just can not picture anyone else doing it that well). Margot Robbie is absolute perfection and Michael Cera's ""Allan"" is just hilarious. Not to mention the rest of the cast. It was surprisingly very touching, poignant, and extremely nostalgic. I mean they got everything perfect. Every touch of the playhouses, the outfits. I loved that the entire audience went dressed in pink. The little girl in me was *screaming*. Loved every single part of it. The Kens revolution and dance sequence are just so creative. I would watch this over and over. So thoughtful.10 out of 45 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"I have many opinions when it comes to this movie. The movie itself was great, but as everything in life nothing is perfect.Why a 7 out of 10? You may ask yourself, well even though the movie was great produced, had a great casting, great costumes and of course an impressive set, the plot was weak. The fact that Barbie (Margot Robbie) did not last even five minutes in the Real World disappointed me. I know that she was supposed to find Gloria (America Ferrera) to get ""fixed"", so she could go home and be the stereotypical barbie again, which in fact was the main plot of the movie, at first. However, she finds her real fast, not giving Barbie enough time to get to know the Real World, aside from the disrespectful male individuals in the beginning. I would have liked Barbie to experience the Real World in a different way, even though the Real World is messed up. I think it would have been nice for Barbie to eat an ice cream for the first time that was not made of plastic or simply for Ken to feel the water at the beach and realize it was not made of plastic or foam as well.Another thing that I did not like was that some characters from Barbie Dreamhouse were not in the movie, such as Ryan, Raquelle, and Nikki, but it was better like that because we all know Raquelle and her unexplainable need to be more successful than barbie at everything. Although at some points I wonder what would have been like if Raquelle were in the movie and totally interfered with Barbie's plan of getting fixed in the Real World.Let us talk about Ken (Ryan Gosling) for a minute. I must say that, at first, I found Ryan Gosling unfit for the Ken role, but I am completely happy with the way he portrayed his character. He made me laugh so much with his facial expressions and his speeches. I went to watch the movie for Barbie and ended up in love with Ken's character. However, Ken might have been funny, but when he totally invaded Barbie's house and threw her clothes away, I found it mean and disrespectful. Yet we have never thought about the Kens for a second, like where do they go when the Barbies go to sleep.I feel like they took this movie as a huge Mattel propaganda, instead of what it should have been. A fun movie where Barbie ventures into an unknow world for the first time trying to get her ""problems"" fixed but having to bear with Ken throughout the whole trip; like those comedy movies where a duo must stick together through a difficult situation even though they do not entirely love each other's personality.At last, I loved how Barbie did not need a man to be happy or complete and I also loved how Ken realized that he didn't need Barbie for him to be Kenough. Not like in Dreamhouse where Ken is always so clingy and needy of Barbie just because. Like Barbie don't need no man to be Barbie. I also loved Allan and his awkwardness, so sad that they discontinued him and Midge. I would have liked to see Ken and Allan as buddies, after all that's why Allan was created, to be Ken's buddy, although I don't think they would have clicked.Margot did an amazing job as Barbie and so did Ryan as Ken. I love them both and loved their acting in this as well, I truly enjoyed the movie expect the little things mentioned previously.1 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Although the Barbie movie's funny bits were good for one viewing, and there were several funny bits throughout the film, I think the writer/director wrote herself into a corner so the ending just falls flat. The parodies were funny, and the contrasts with real life were funny, but the writers just didn't know where to go with the story in the end. A lot of Greta Gerwig's films are like that. Disappointing. I wouldn't see the Barbie movie more than once, which is sad, because I've seen Dial of Destiny four times, and I am going back for a fifth viewing. That film did not disappoint! This one could have been a lot better.21 out of 30 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",5,Barbie
"I went into the theatre thinking this is gonna be a little girls movie, about dolls and weird stuff. I thought it was gonna be a boring almost 2h movie about dolls, but oh boy was I wrong.not only was the theatre almost full on the third day of it airing, it was also: funny, inspiring, sad, and at times pretty confusing. It pretty much all felt like a fever dream, but in a good way. It also contained some jokes that were definitely for the adult/young-adult audience, but they were okay for teens like myself and the friend group i went with. Like, Barbie casually drops the word 'vagina' and Ken is talking about his genitals in a non-direct way, but the intention was still there. Some jokes landed pretty flat, but the big majority was very fun. Also the word 'patriarchy' was used way too many times by Ken (Ryan Gosling) and it felt almost annoying. The movie featured songs by the artists: Lizzo, Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish, Nicki Minaj and unfortunately Ice Spice. The soundtrack was absolutely incredible, maybe exept Ice Spice's song that was only heard at the credit roll, right at the end. We all know the movie was carried by the amazing Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, but I'd say Kate McKinnon's caracter and acting In conclusion this is a pretty good movie, and if you have the opportunity you should watch it.28 out of 95 found this helpful.

Fun, empowering, intelligent, socially relevant, deeply moving and by far the pinkest movie l've ever seen! An all around an amazing experience and there's something in it for everyone! All genders, all ages, everyone can appreciate it. The entire audience seemed to have a blast throughout the movie. Everyone was laughing during the funny bits(and there were A LOT of them) and during the heartfelt, more emotional moments you could feel the energy shift and the messages the movie was trying to convey really being taken in.

"Storyline: 8.5- Great story, could've been fleshed out in some areas to have even more overall connection, but it makes overall sense. A little silly at times; but I'm not complaining, I mean it is a story about Barbie. Pacing was good and easy to follow. It is, in my opinion, the perfect movie length, at an hour and 54 minutes.Cinematography: 8.75- There are some really great cinematic shots throughout the film. Very clear distinction between ""Barbie Land"" and ""The Real World"".Acting- 9.75- The acting was wonderful. Every actor pulled their weight and shined. Many comedic moments that will have you laughing nearly to tears. Also, There are serious moments that are executed well in such a way that may even bring you to tears (as they did to me).Music Music Soundtrack: 9.5- Overall, extremely strong movie music soundtrack. All of the songs align with the theme of what is happening during the current scenes & the storyline. Great modern day popular artists chosen, including Lizzo, Dua Lippa, Nicki Minaj, Ice Spice, Sam Smith, Tame Impala, and others. The weakest song (and I mean from a vocal standpoint) is the one sung by Ryan Gosling.Choreography- 9- There is a fair amount of choreography in the film, and there is an all-Ken dancing scene that is phenomenal.Overall: 9.1.5 out of 26 found this helpful.

"When I went to watch this movie, I went to watch it as the amazing combo, Barbinheimer (Barbie and Oppenheimer). I tried my best to avoid spoilers for both of these movies, and let me just say, going into this movie blind made this a phenomenal experience. The way Stereotypical Barbie changes is a pleasant surprise. And the way this movie deals with problems in modern society upfront and, while admittedly toned down a bit, they're all still there. The plot of this movie makes it a fantastic watch, and I was delighted by not only how the jokes were seamlessly thrown in, but the jokes themselves. This movie wasn't only just Kenough. This was so much more than being just Kenough for the children and adults in the audience. The movie's so self-aware, but it isn't the usual type, this is a type of self-awareness that can lead you to view the world differently. The problems Barbie struggles with aren't unreasonable, they're relatable at heart and spread a good message. This movie is wonderful and I highly recommend it.3 out of 15 found this helpful.

"What could have been a cute concept was overproduced with obvious writer infighting pulling this disaster into all directions. A little girl friendly opening act quickly dissolves into act two social discussion that would leave any little girl bewildered. The family next to us described their three little ones as totally confused and everyone they heard discussing it was very disappointed with this disaster caused by feuding writers or a director who scored hilarious with ""Good Boys"". So, not for kids, and parents should wait for home viewing so they can turn it off when it wears really thin about a half hour in: the time it is realized its just not going to get any better and you turn it off thankful you didn't waste any money.50 out of 84 found this helpful.

"As the film's trailer suggests, whether you like or dislike Barbie dolls and merchandise, there's still plenty of things to enjoy about Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie."" Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are brilliantly cast as Barbie and Ken where they both have awesome chemistry and share plenty of hilarious moments on-screen. I should also add that Gosling delivers what's probably one of the best musical solos of the year next to Jack Black's performance in The Super Mario Bros Movie.""Barbie"" is not only an eccentric, goofball comedy but also a thought-provoking film with a post-feminist take on gender roles and gender stereotypes in current society, something highly reminiscent of movies such as ""The Ugly Truth"" or ""Down With Love."" On that note, America Ferrera's powerful monologue near the end of ""Barbie"" was on par with Renée Zellweger's speech in ""Down With Love.""While the above description might make it sound like the Barbie movie leans too much into polemics for it to be good escapist fun then don't worry, because aside from its core message, it's still oodles of light-hearted, hilarious entertainment for everyone to enjoy from beginning to end.0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"I read from many sources about Barbie being a hardcore feminist movie, just as bad as all recent Lucasfilm sludge. I'm happy to report it is not true.Barbie and Ken have their separate, but equal story arcs. Ken goes on adventure of self discovery and ultimately learns his value outside just being there just for Barbie.Barbie's part of the story lingers a lot on the paradox that she is meant to be an icon of emancipation, but is also blamed for setting the wrong standards and gets some hate for it.There are also real human characters, which are compelling at first, but rather simplistic.The storytelling frequently stops to explore and explain too many messages about society, equality, misogyny and troubles if growing up and being a woman or a mother.The writing has some problems, bad jokes and the last twelve minutes are utterly pointless. But overall it delivered what it promised in a very nice package.The sets and cinematography are top notch, as well as the acting.7 out of 38 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Barbie had to carry the weight of everyone's expectations (just what the movie is talking about), and people are disappointed because they expected barbie movie to be amazing, perfect and everything in between. The barbie topic, no matter how superficial it may seem, is not easy to grasp and hard to portray. I think Greta did an amazing job, both Margot and Ryan played their part so well, and speech from America made me cry with few tears, all that was said is what all women feel. Billie's song was cherry on top. An 8 on surface since I thought to myself - why would they include such badly executed cgi, and a 10, because um, it's barbie, it's barbie land... it isn't real life, and men should be glad that it's not.16 out of 59 found this helpful.

"This one reminds me of why I love movies so much. Acting, dancing, visual arts, screenplay, plots, soundtracks, humor, moral, there are everything we need in a movie. What hit me the most is that I was only expecting the kind of adult humor in that Barbie song ""You can brush my hair undress me everywhere,"" but at some point I realize it's way more than that. The movie was hilarious that I remember my mouth was opened laughing the whole time you know, all the Barbie jokes. And it's so cute that just right at the beginning of the movie, I instantly fell back to my childhood memories and everything is pink it's so beautiful. Yet, it's such a deep movie that it told things we almost be numb to. It said it out loud to remind us who we are and what are our worth and where are we going and everything. It's a movie about love. I cried so hard and laughed so hard. It's a masterpiece.3 out of 9 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"This plot of Barbie unexpected, I watched it with no real expectations and no other knowledge about what it would be like. Barbie took me by surprise at it had a super deep and meaningful plot on being a woman, what the barbie life is like vs what it actually is like to be a woman. Plus the ken parts were super hilarious, the whole cinema was falling out of our seats at Ryan Gosling, he played Ken so well. And it was great to have these funny moments through out, when some of the parts were more serious. But I wish it had more barbie references, maybe from the movies which is such a memory for me growing up, but it seemed to focus more on Barbies with jobs trying to show that Girls can grow up to do anything, but I guess they couldn't cater to everything as it might've been to hard to squeeze it all it.But other than that this movie was enjoyable, maybe not one of my favourites and I might not watch it again, but seeing it in the cinema was such a great atmosphere and it was fun to see everyone dress up and have fun and laugh together! <3.0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"Barbie blew my expectations away. I have never seen such a brilliantly written movie that makes me want to immediately rewatch. Every detail was thought of in Barbie's world and the satire of the Ken's and patriarchal society was hilarious and relatable as a woman. The dialogue was perfectly childish (as if children were playing with the barbie's speaking) and intelligent. America Ferrara's monologue about the hardships of being a woman was spot on and every woman in the theater could relate. The movie was fun and heartfelt while also drawing attention to society's imperfections. Men who say this film isn't good or ""anti-man"", is part of the problem.3 out of 9 found this helpful.

This movie was worth going to the theater I thought it was a good idea and there ware some really good jokes haw ever there are a few holes in the story and I feel like Barbie's personality was very empty I know that that is kind of how it's supposed to be because Barbie is a dal but for me I need to have a memorable mane characters. A other thing I liked about the movie was the opening scene lats just say it MIGHT BE Really FUNNY. There were a lot of scenes in this were the hole theater was lagging so loud l couldn't hear a thing. I also never played with barbies so I didn't get any of the references but yeah I think movie was decent.0 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink,6,Barbie
"The movie starts great, but goes off the rails soon after. Had they kept the look and feel of the first 30 minutes, this movie could've been great.For positives, the cast is great in general. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling do a great job as ""Stereotypical Barbie"" and Ken. Barbieland also looks vividly colorful and full of references to the toys themselves anyone who played with Barbie toys will recognize.For negatives, It is not a fun movie at its core. The movie pits women against men and it has a negative and political messaging. It's a ""lecturing feminist"" and ""bring down the patriarchy"" kind of movie. I wasn't expecting it to turn out this way from the trailers and was honestly surprised by it.In general, if you're looking for a lighthearted movie about Barbies (and Kens) where you can kick back, relax and have some laughs, this movie is not it.181 out of 256 found this helpful.

"The most anticipated summer movie turned out to meet my expectations. The sets,acting,costumes,story line everything was pink magic. It is a very inspiring movie for girls but I think a bit too much feminism and toxicity.No doubt, the movie is advertising barbies but it's still a good find.It's light hearted and it kept it's humor throughout the film., even in deep scenes. The cast was perfect for their own respective roles but something was very disappointing for me that literally Dua Lipa's role was less than two minutes.Overall I think the movie is worth watching once in your life and it will be memorable. The soundtrack is perfect Dance the night by Dua Lipa was perfectly in place and also What was I made for.When I watched What was I made for on YouTube, I did not like it but in the cinema it was perfect.It is a great movie but not everyone will like it Waiting for Barbie number 2 now. Hopefully next summer.1 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9,Barbie
"I went into Wednesday expecting to write things like ""the greatest weekend in cinema"", ""Oppenheimer brings cinema to the screen again"", ""Barbie wins the weekend""... But this is so much more than that.Barbie was perfect. It shows something that I was able to experience for the first time in my life: the artistic pleasure of movies as a communal and cultural experience. Although watching Titanic was one of the greatest communal experiences of my life, it's the immediate cultural relevance of Barbie that makes it a first for me. It's the best that movies can be. And above all else, in six years time this might be looked back upon as one of the best movies of the decade.In the consumerist world's perfect fantasy sold to little girls as a toy-the polished plastic world of Barbie-everything is perfect. Starting with Barbie herself. Until the doll experiences something all too common to the real world but inexplicably strange to hers: an inexplicable desire to die. We get acquainted with the situation following a musical set-piece opening of the kind that tells you you're in for a great ride! (A pleasure made double for any Dua Lipa fan!)As it turns out, someone in the real world (Gloria (America Ferrera) a woman working an office job at Mattel) has communicated these emotions to her. It's now up to Barbie to travel to the real world to repair the rift in the space-time continuum. Her typical but good guy boyfriend Ken joins in for the ride.In the sweet and softhearted comedy that follows, Ken and Barbie make their first encounter with the real world, where Barbie finds out she's only ever sexualized, and Ken is treated with a newly discovered respect that he never knew in the Barbie world. Gradually, he discovers the patriarchy. When Barbie finally meets Gloria and her teenage daughter (beautifully cast and great showing from young Ariana Greenblatt) after they help her escape a chase with the corporate goons at Mattel that preside upon the cubical empire, the journey is done and they happily return to Barbieland. Only there's one problem: Ken has brought the patriarchy back home!With the visual representations of masculinity in popular culture (pretty much Rocky Balboa), outrageous rocker outfits, and a great fancy of horses (I share this with Ken I have to say), Ken has now amassed all the aesthetics he needs to firmly establish the rule of the patriarchy in Barbieland. The comedy is bafflingly funny, and the subject is urgently topical.I've lately had the feeling that movies today weren't as important as they used to, that they didn't mean as much and like Quentin Tarantino said and I agree, ""they're not in the zeitgeist (the spirit of the age)."" This movie was right in the zeitgeist!It's thanks to a collaboration between Warner Brothers, Mattel (kudos to them for having the sense of humor), and an artist like Greta Gerwig that we're able to have her take something so deeply established in the pop culture and marry it with the standalone work of an artist and its integrity. The result is something I've never seen in a theater before.In a scene where Barbie is experiencing an emotional breakdown, Gloria transitions into a long-running monologue about how it was like for her to be a woman in today's world. I sat and watched and thought it might had been something a bit clichéd and worn out. Everyone had settled into silence. Then the moment Gloria was done with the monologue, there was a pause, with her and with the audience, then the whole room erupted into applause! I joined right in! What the hell did I know... When the movie kept getting more and more exciting, and just transitioned into a modern-day musical set-piece this time around, people were so with it they had to applaud again. It was a truly great thing to see. (US audiences and people in Marvel movies are known to cheer for many things, but this was a different degree of sincerity.) At the end of it there was a buzz in the room, like everyone had just been part of something special.Essentially you know it's a great situation, you have no idea where the movie might go next, and it keeps coming up with the right answer every single time. It's perfect.More props to Greta; like all the truly great movies, it's also very personal. At first it's personal in the relevant but quirky mention of Rocky Balboa and The Godfather as symbols of the male-revolving world-movies that she herself wanting to be a filmmaker had had to deal with as deeply cherished and highly regarded in the masculine opinion around her-and it's personal again in the ending, and what she sees as most cherishable about being human, in what will stay with me as one of the classic shots of all time. The shot comes with Margot Robbie's perfecting of the single-eyed tear and using it the way you imagine they would in the great old times of cinema, except it's that much better because the times are today.I've seen reviews (The Guardian) calling this a feminist thesis. It's neither a thesis (see Women Talking) nor a dogma. It's entirely cultural. And despite the story largely being a comedy about women banding together and helping each other break free of the omnipotent clamps of the patriarchy, Ken, who is an absolute joy in this movie, is treated to a delicate ending as well. The role was also a total gift of a role and Ryan Gosling was right there for it.It's also the movie's quality as a journey of spiritual discovery, confrontation, and self-actualization, along with the great tradition of the Hollywood ending, that bring everything together and make this a proper pop culture opus.As far as what this implies for the industry, this is the first time that we'll be able to have a strongly established director that isn't one of the folks who made their name in the 90s. This is not to say that Greta Gerwig is now going to make a Barbie every other year, nor does she have to. This is her Pulp Fiction, her Raiders of the Lost Ark, and dare I say her Godfather (wink wink). May she enjoy it. But she's definitely on my short list now of the most exciting directors working today, and someone that can carry the torch of great cinema wherever she goes next. I remember hearing her answer with Singin' in the Rain (1952) to a favorite movie question in a roundtable interview, and thinking who was this girl. Then I happened to see Singin' in the Rain a month later, and I knew that girl was cool.Finally, I'm glad that an entire generation of young girls gets to grow up with a movie like this available to them. It's definitely not something Greta's generation had, not quite. It's also a culmination of the last ten years of popular culture, which is why I think it's one of the best movies of this period. But it's also gonna be remembered and talked about for decades to come. And based on its feminist scope, it might be already one of the most important movies of the 21st century.22 out of 60 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Well, English is not my first language so I'll try my best here.With the complete deconstruction of the concept of ""Barbie"", Gerwig subverted every stereotype you've associated with this ""not-so-feminist"" toy. She took an innovative approach to story-telling, struck a balance between flamboyant shots and down-to-earth narrative. Behind every joke there is a harsh reality. It's light-hearted yet solemn, comprehensible yet arduous, optimistic yet depressing. For I know this world is not gonna be as acceptable as the movie wants it to be. Just look at these 1 reviews here. I hope Gerwig will make more movies like Barbie because I need it, we need it.17 out of 64 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I completely enjoyed Greta Gerwig's outstanding movie Barbie. It was delightful to see on the big screen with the great soundtrack and the eye-popping colors. Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie and she made a great movie even better.Someone asked why a 60+ adult female like me would go to see this kids movie.For me, Barbie was such a huge part of my childhood. Playing ""Barbs"" with my best friend as a young girl is one of my most cherished memories. It was something just for girls when we were mostly excluded from being in any lead role in the world (our moms, aunts, grandma's were excluded too). No sports, few female leads in film or television, few jobs outside of the pink collar ghetto we were kept in. Barbie was beautiful and the center of her own story. For this reason I had to go on opening weekend to vote for the world of Barbie, to say, thank you.3 out of 17 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Going into the movie, i went in mostly blind and didn't expect much into the way it explored a deeper and more abstract plotline. Cast was star-studded and everything seemed to be in place, nothing off there. However, to me, the movie couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a more serious movie with a straight plotline or being goofy with a more abstract plotline. I think the humor was well-executed, but the movie leaned too much into both sides. By doing that, the potential in the movie if they had picked and focused on one solely was diminished. Excellent individual performances from ferrell, gosling, and greenblatt.1 out of 8 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",7,Barbie
"Barbie is definitely one of the best films to bought out to cinemas this year, or even longer than that. It had us laughing from the start to finish, crying in some moments and scenes so overall it was an emotional rollercoaster. Greta has done a great job and balanced a mix of fun and hard truths about the world we live in today. For people say this isn't worth watching, clearly don't know how to let a film just transport you away into its world for a moment, absolutely brilliant film, I'd pay to go and watch it again. Well done to Greta, Margot, Ryan and all of the cast & crew for a fantastic watch!12 out of 29 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Well, scenography is nice, wardrobe is nice and actress are pretty. The plot is non existent and the whole movie tries to be something it's not - a social commentary so it dives in whole other area and topics and fails. I didn't have any expectations coming to the cinema, I just assumed it was light and funny movie but instead I got a speech about patriarchy and men's world. Not to say it isn't but it's not something you would expect from a Barbie movie that was marketed as fun and comedy movie.Development of the characters is non existent so they are constantly changing their mood and personality without any explanation.56 out of 80 found this helpful.

"My 20 year old daughter and I loved this movie so much. It was adorable and funny and surprisingly heartwarming. I really think anyone would enjoy this though. It had such a sweet simple message done so colorfully. Perfect casting. Margot Robbie literally is a doll. And Ryan Gosling is a combination of hot and funny. We wore pink of course and saw some cute outfits. A couple Ken shirts. While we were leaving, still teary eyed, seeing the mothers, daughters, friends and sisters all wearing pink, it was so touching and we thought how lucky they were to be able to watch Barbie for the first time. I still feel emotional hours later thinking about it. Highly recommend.14 out of 36 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"This was definitely an entertaining movie but it went in so many different directions at times. Also, the product placement and clear control from Mattel takes you out of the fantasy at times. Honestly, it is unique and not something really done before, so it gets points for that. It's a lot though. Just a lot going on, and not all of what was going on was necessary.Also, Ryan Gosling is not the best singer or dancer. It was cheesy and over the top. I'm glad I saw it in theaters because if it was on a streaming service I'd probably turn it off as it was so weird. It's worth watching so you're in on the hype and pop culture reference this will surely become.0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",6,Barbie
"Was walking into this movie expecting a light-harder fun movie about Barbie and Ken, but left questioning the systemic inequality in our society. What many men will tell you is that this movie is just another woke feminist movie, but I highly encourage everyone to go watch Barbie to truly understand how women feel in todays world. Furthermore the production of the movie was greath. Everything from the cast, the plot, the pacing, the acting, the cinematography and ending was well done. I already know this movie is gonna cause lots of polarisation, but I would recommend everyone to watch this movie and come to their own conclusions.8 out of 37 found this helpful.

"I had high hopes for this film and have been looking forward to it for about a year. I was blown away by the level of humor, the emotion, the meaning, everything! Honestly, it should've been called Ken, as Ryan Gosling stole the show. I've always thought that he was underrated as a comedic actor. He was Ken. He owned it. He deserves awards for completely giving himself over to the character. Having said that, the entire cast was awesome. The music was incredible. The set design was perfect. I laughed and cried throughout. I didn't expect all of the feels, but there were so many messages that touched my heart. I look forward to many more viewings.4 out of 12 found this helpful.

"""Barbie"" may seem like an improbable concept for a thought-provoking film, but director Greta Gerwig skillfully harnesses this cultural icon to deliver a potent and profound message. Gerwig delicately weaves a narrative that explores the complexities of gender dynamics without vilifying either gender, demonstrating that Kens in Barbieland face similar challenges as real-world women. The film also touches on the importance of embracing diversity and dismantling societal barriers. The movie's production design deserves applause, staying true to the beloved Barbie toys while ingeniously utilizing their features to propel the story forward. Margot Robbie delivers a phenomenal performance as Barbie, injecting depth and nuance into a character often dismissed as one-dimensional. Ryan Gosling, as Ken, complements the film with his adept portrayal, enhancing the chemistry between the characters, while America Ferrera's character brings a layer of relatability to the story. Gerwig's clever balance of humor and poignancy ensures that the movie achieves its goal of raising awareness without alienating its audience. A delightful yet meaningful cinematic experience.3 out of 28 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9,Barbie
"Summary: This isn't the fun, light-hearted fantasy the marketing would have you believe. It is instead a clunky film that is nearly all social commentary. In fact, the plot and protagonist of the film is the patriarchy and more specifically men. The result is a sexist film that can be good at times but frustrating for many viewers. The movie may even be damaging to woman (explanation below).Full Review:I will justify my summary above but I want to first share that the film has a tremendous amount of potential and that I will be looking forward to a sequel should it come out. The cast is excellent. Gosling absolutely steals the show and is clearly having a ton of fun. Robbie is also a gem and is the quintessential Barbie. They could not have picked a better cast. The set design was fun and probably exactly what you would hope for in a Barbie film. The tempo was great, the cameos were fun, the movie was appropriately self-aware, the humor generally landed well. It's probably not a kids movie and I think that I wouldn't want my kids to attend it do to the adult humor and the social commentary bit. I think that for the right audiences the social commentary might elicit some good discussions and may be interesting to some.I don't mind social commentary but I'd prefer to know that its in the film before I go. If I do go see a movie with social commentary its not generally as clunky as the movie Barbie is. For example, after the movie I asked several people what they thought was the message of the movie and no one person had the same answer. Surely the message centers around feminism or woman's empowerment. These are themes that generally everyone can get behind but the movie isn't clear on specifics. Does the movie intend to convey that Barbie is problematic as a doll or symbol? Is the movie suggesting the patriarchy is a problem? Is it that woman can do anything they put their mind to it? Is it saying the diversity is important? Basically... the movie fails to pinpoint what exactly it is trying to comment on.Generally if you go see a movie that is intended to be social commentary then you should come out of it with thought provoking questions and ideas. It should be a movie that ""flips the script"" so that if you are on the opposite side of an issue you become more aware/informed after watching the movie. Unfortunately Barbie doesn't do this. Barbie lives in a fantasy world but the real world n the film is also a fantasy. She doesn't face any real world or realistic dilemma causing us to evaluate the gender systems we have in place. Even the times Barbie is subjected to discrimination or sexism (which is fairly constant) these times are not realistic or believable. Thus the commentary comes off as preachy and anecdotal.Barbie is also not a role model or a hero in the movie. It's weird watching a movie that is written to empower woman while also featuring a weak and sexist female lead. The film begins with Barbie dismissing men and being biased towards woman. I don't want to leave any spoilers but.... SEMI-SPOILER... the movie ends with things being unequal between the sexes. As a result the film almost suggests that the sexes shouldn't be treated equally. In other words, its clear Barbie and Barbie the movie believes females are the superior gender.Moreover, Barbie is not a strong and powerful woman. We are told in the movie that Barbie is an inspiration to woman fairly constantly. Normally I would agree. But the Barbie in this movie is depicted as uncapable and weak. She is egocentric and motivated by a desire to be beautiful. In fact, the entire plot kicks off because she finds cellulite on her legs and it later revolves around her self-centered interests to maintain power in her community. Its hard to relate or feel sympathetic under these circumstances and if anything the plot is an indictment on woman's (and societies) overuse of beauty and sexuality. As Barbie trots along her path she doesn't overcome anything on her own and she doesn't change as a person. In fact, everything she ""accomplishes"" is because someone told her what to do or because someone else did something for her. Not one time can I recall did Barbie accomplish something on her own or reevaluate her positions. By the end of the movie she is still the same problematic Barbie we were first introduced to. This is an interesting problem because it means that Ken, the movie's antagonist is actually the hero of the film. He is the only one in the film that overcomes adversity and is the only one in the film who grows and changes. We don't root for Ken, of course, but if you spend a few minutes thinking about his character arch you will realize he is actually the victim and the hero of the movie. This is what I meant by saying it is a clunky film - it has too many mixed messages, unexplored and unrealistic themes, and watered down but constant social commentary. Then add the fact that the social commentary expressed in the film is of a serious issue but is juxtaposed with a lighthearted comedic tone.Then there is the problem with the movie's portrayal of men and specifically Ken. First, lets acknowledge how woman have been poorly portrayed in past by depicting them as weak and needing men. We can agree its inappropriate - so its confusing as to why the film does the same thing, except to men. Ken is portrayed as inferior to Barbie in every way when the appropriate thing to do would be highlight the strengths in both genders. A counter argument people may make is, ""Dude, its just a movie about a doll and its a fantasy land."" I get it, its not real. But the problem is the movie depicts men as inferior and stupid in both the fantasy and real world. In fact, there is little distinction between the men in both worlds. On the other hand, the woman in the real world are depicted more genuinely and certainly more intelligently. This leads me to conclude that the writers likely do have a problem with men even if they were trying to be humorous. In fact, there is a whole subplot with an all male corporate board that seems to be a non-sequitur. It seems its only purpose in the film was to dump on men or, in the alternative, the whole subplot was intended to be something intelligent but ended up being too poorly conceived to be meaningful in any way.So, I have to say the film is disappointing and problematic in so many ways. But the potential is huge. I would look forward to a sequel but they have to drop the social commentary or, in the alternative, make a more cohesive movie with less mixed signals. Barbie should demonstrate why she is so amazing and earn her place at the top. We don't see why she is special or see her become the hero in her own movie. I expected to see a movie about a powerful woman who also likes to have fun. What I got instead was a bait and switch.31 out of 50 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I didn't have a lot of big expectations for this movie, so imagine how happy and surprised I was about how much I enjoyed it! It's silly, and fun and then BOOM- existentialism! While I wouldn't recommend this movie for under 10- there's A LOT of innuendo that will probably go over many younger viewers heads, but there are a couple parts that might not be best for the littles, IMO. The soundtrack is amazing and the story is a lot deeper than one would expect! Margot Robbie is a delight, as is Ryan Gosling. The entire cast is wonderful! Issa Rae never disappoints and her role as President Barbie! A truly fun summer movie!15 out of 39 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"The plot is interesting enough to make you feel interested and intrigued even if you're not a barbie fan or just not a fan of cliches, it has a beautiful meaning behind it and it's the best movie for you to watch if you're a woman . This movie is great , i usually don't watch movies with high hopes but i did with this one and still it surprised me . The marketing crew did an insanely perfect job , the hole mall was wearing pink and it helped people on building the hype for the movie. The whole thing is genius, the performances ( specially ryan and margot ) are outstanding and genuinely really good , the direction is great and the whole soundtrack is fantastic. Final consideration : GO WATCH BARBIE , it's worth it.4 out of 11 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8,Barbie
"This movie was such great experience to live. It's a fun, entertaining, deep, and amazing piece of art. It was very funny at times, made me cry other times, and made me feel nostalgic and warm and proud and all of these different feelings. But most importantly it made me think! I really love it when movies discuss topics that matter and shake your ideas a little bit. I loved the cast, the costume designs, the music and everything in between. Margot Robbie is a queen, her acting was amazing and she's just the perfect cast for this role. Also, Ryan did an amazing job and so did the rest of the cast. Judging by the propaganda that surrounded it and the hype around it I didn't have high expectations but honestly I was pleasantly surprised. Also, I have to say that the story of this movie is very very similar to ""Free guy"" the one with Ryan Reynolds but it was done well so I can't complain.3 out of 15 found this helpful.

"LOVED IT. Truly an amazing movie. A lot of people would maybe say that it's boring but to me it was super super cool, it held my attention from start to finish. Not just a movie this thing isnan experience that brings me so much joy if you go to the cinema. So many people there, dressed in pinkish clothes, feels like everyone there is happy and all of people there are unites under the idea of Barbie. The movie itself, has so many great messages to the word. I am sure a lot of little girls didn't quite understand it but they will one day. It also had so many real word/trensing things added to it.I probably liked it so much because I grew up watching old barbie movies, and now it felt like Barbie has grown with me, especially cause the topic of the movie was very real in todays world.Going in before the movie I thought it would turn out to be just ""okay"" since I saw a lot of parts from it as trailers I thought ""oh I alredy saw it all"", nahh, little did i know. Those trailers are nothing compared to this.I really reccomend watching it. But there are some parts that are ""not for kids""(ex. Some things they say, initiate...), But it's just maybe 3 times in all 114minutes of the movie.15 out of 44 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Barbie is a new fantasy comedy directed, part written and produced by Greta Gerwig, director of Lady Bird and Little Women.In Barbieland, everything is perfect and everything runs smoothly. Yet Barbie (Margot Robbie) learns that something is not right and everything suddenly seems less than perfect for her. Because of this, she decides to travel to the real world, to find out what's going on.On this journey she is accompanied by Ken (Ryan Gosling), who secretly tried to go with her. Together they now try to figure out what's going on, but learn that the real world is very different compared to Barbieland.Greta Gerwig, together with the photography director Rodrigo Prieto, knows how to convey the Barbie world well, making it seem as if you are in a life-sized doll's room as a viewer. They used beautiful film sets for this. Thus, the film works well as long as it is set in the Barbieland. Only that everyone here is Barbie or Ken sometimes makes it a bit difficult to follow the exact differences between all Barbies and Kens.When the story moves to the real world, it changes the movie a bit. For example, how exactly it is possible to travel between the two worlds is not really clearly explained. Furthermore, the movie loses credibility when Barbie and Ken can do anything in the real world with no real consequences. Due to the lack of explanation and an eye for detail, the film can sometimes come across as a bit strange.In a comical way, they also try to make fun of both gender roles. For example, Barbieland should represent the opposite of the real world. In Barbieland, Barbies and Kens can do anything, but Barbie is often above Ken. In the real world, men often seem to be above women. For example, they try to divide this role in the opposite way. For male viewers, who do not like these current feminism movements, this can make this film less.Despite multiple actors and actresses playing different Barbies and Kens, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling manage to portray their roles in more unique ways alongside the other Barbies and Kens cast members. Margot Robbie comes across as a real Barbie, trying to discover what her life destinies really are. Ryan Gosling manages to provide plenty of appropriate comedic moments as Ken, who tries to make Barbie notice him. In the real world, however, he learns that as Ken, he can also do other things without Barbie. Will Ferrell plays the CEO of Mattel, the toy company that makes the barbie doll. His character and the other employees are supposed to be in the real world, but they seem more like they're also in a cartoon world because of the ways they act. This makes the concept of the real world seem a bit unusual. If they brought out the real world a little better, the movie could have been a little better.The Barbie and Ken concept is better brought to the fore in Toy Story 3, for example, where these dolls and the idea they stand for are also handled a bit playfully.5 out of 7 found this helpful.

"I have watched barbie since I was born, I've collected the dolls the dresses and many other barbie themed things. I know all the movies by heart and the songs and I love barbie so when I saw this movies trailer and the marketing I went crazy!! I was so excited to watch it and support this movie.The beginning of the movie was quite fun and funny, very colorful. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling play their roles so well and really carry the movie. It contained all the things expected from a barbie movie. The plot was great but halfway through the movie it becomes very serious and turns a bit preachy so if you want to take your kids to the movies to watch this, Id suggest not doing so because I don't think they'll understand much about patriarchy and sexism, its definitely not aimed at younger children (12 and below).I was hoping for some more funny moments and homage to the barbie movies so I was a tad bit disappointed not to see it however it was still a nice movie, enjoyable and a feel good movie.I understand the message given out that you can be whoever you want to be but it could have been slightly more light hearted .1 out of 6 found this helpful.

"Didn't watch the trailer and went to see the Barbie movie, thinking it would be a regular comedy about a doll. I liked the idea of dressing up in pink with my daughter and going to a girly movie. But I was very surprised when I found out that there was a deep meaning hidden in the pink world of Barbie Land! The movie touches on women's issues: being always perfect, managing everything, being beautiful, perfect mothers, cooks, careerists and wives. The movie also shows men who don't know who they are without their women, cars, jobs. I cried, I was moved by the dialogues. I loved the movie! I was especially impressed by the moment at the bus stop, when Barbie sat next to an old lady and praised her for her beauty. The old lady smiled and said: I know :) It was so cute and wise! It made me realize that growing old is not scary if you love yourself as you are. You don't need to chase youth, there is beauty and dignity in every age. I am grateful to the directors Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach for making the Barbie movie not only a fun comedy, but also a deep drama about finding yourself and your place in the world. They showed that Barbie is not just a doll, but a heroine who can be anyone and do anything. They also honored the memory of Ruth Handler, who gave millions of girls the opportunity to dream and strive for the best. I think that the Barbie movie is not only a movie for children, but also for adults who want to go back to their roots and find their inner beauty. I recommend this movie to everyone who loves Barbie or just wants to watch a good movie with an important message.18 out of 55 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Barbie is a modern fantasy with lots of metaphors about existentialism & feminism, and how everybody (men & women) should get equal opportunity. The archetypal Barbie & Ken have fulfilling story arcs. As do the main human characters when Barbie World and the Real World collide. That collision is a big part of making this a fantasy.It looks and sounds great. Its messages are fab. It'll annoy the right people. It's a big-budget Gerwig & Baumbach film. I love their films. I loved this. I'll be making at least one more trip to the cinema to see it again, and it'll be an instant buy when available on iTunes.1 out of 8 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Such a silly, beautiful, wonderful movie! This is truly a cinematic masterpiece. It has heart, soul, and lots of laughs. I've seen it twice so far and it honestly gets better with each watch. I'm looking forward to owning it when it comes out for purchase as well. This will definitely be one I watch a lot. Ryan Gosling's Ken is everything, and he's absolutely perfect. This entire movie is perfect. I don't want to say too much and spoil anything for those that haven't seen it yet, so just go ahead and do yourself a favor and go see it. What are you waiting for? P. S. Isn't not ""sexist"" it's making a point, and people that have a problem with what it's saying should probably ask themselves why and look inwards.4 out of 17 found this helpful.

"Making a Barbie movie about feminism is a cool idea. Having Barbie comment on the patriarchy just like Animal Farm about communism and Wall Street about capitalism. It's admirable and the message gets through.The problem is that the actual movie is so bad. Even though you buy in on the two worlds, etc, etc. In the end, it was like reading a textbook instead of a novel. Normally, the strengths with fables and allegories is that they are profound on many levels. Here, everything is spelled out from a a teacher's desk and the whole film comes across as bit thin.I would not watch this movie again.72 out of 129 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"This movie is so good. It is existential, funny, childish, and adult at the same time.It is uncomfortable in the way that it perverts reality turning it on its head, and it forces the audience to confront the uncomfortable truths about reality that we have normalized.This movie invokes a deep sense of sentimentalism, hope, and the beauty of ideas and dreams.Also, can we talk about Margot Robbie???? Does this woman have Oscars, because she is so freaking amazing. When I heard that Margot Robbie was going to be Barbie I was leery. Could Harley Quinn really embody the larger than life legacy of Barbie???Who would Barbie be? Really, a white Barbie with blonde hair as the main character? Isn't that so stereotypical?????Well, let me tell you something. Margot Robbie should give a master class on acting. That woman needs to take a freaking bow and so does Greta Gerwing. I mean seriously...!!! Margot Robbie going from Wolf on Wallstreet, to Harley Quinn, to Babylon, now to Barbie.How does the woman embody two opposing emotions at once with such precision and authenticity????Well, enough fan girl-ing. This movie is awesome. It's a little on the nose with all the patriarchy stuff, but I think it needs to be. It's as though it marches right up to all the critiques it knows it will have and dares them to say something.It reminds me of something a man on tik-tok said recently. Men are told that they are supposed to be respected by women, and respectful women often go unheard. Well, this movie is anything but respectful. It gives patriarchy the 🐦 and reminds us that we are all important not because of our gender but in spite of it.Go out and watch it. Take your kids. You'll laugh, you'll wince, you'll feel excited, you'll dream, you'll empathize, and you'll believe.4 out of 17 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9,Barbie
"I loved this movie more than I thought I would!! I laughed, cried, and honestly loved the message. All the niche references made me smile, too!!Normally I do not rewatch movies while they are in theaters but I am planning on taking my sibling this weekend so they can experience the same joy!I don't understand the people who are upset over Ken being an accessory to Barbie. It is literally pointed out in the movie how misogyny is a huge problem in the real world and they are upset over one validating movie. Unbelievable. Please ignore the ""anti-man"" reviews. This movie isn't anti-man. If anything, it's anti-patriarchy and makes fun of it.12 out of 38 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Watched it twice and enjoyed it even more on the second watch. Definitely not the all-enlightening and god-saving movie to the feminist movement but it does touch on a lot of issues in such a beautiful, greta gerwig-esque way.The Barbie-Gloria, Gloria-Sasha, and Barbie-Ruth interactions are so impactful for mothers and daughters. Teared up a few times and would have definitely full on cried if I was home alone while watching the movie.Ryan Gosling was so good at playing Ken and making the audience laugh at him, laugh with him, feel bad for him, get mad at him, and understand him.Margot Robbie is just overall the perfect Barbie.6 out of 24 found this helpful.

I liked the movie and really enjoyed myself watching it. I did think the feminism was a little too 'on the nose' sometimes. But it's difficult to make a film that caters to all audiences. Overall it was a job well done. The set was beautiful and everything expected from a Barbie movie. Simu Liu and Ryan Gosling were showstealers as rivalling Kens and Margot Robbie was perfectly cast. I was also really surprised that the slogan 'a movie for people who love Barbie and people who hate Barbie' caught the essence. They didn't shy away addressing the controversies surrounding some of the Barbie dolls and Mattel as a company.8 out of 30 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"(Note: I highly recommend seeing both this film and Oppenheimer as a double feature. Both are heavy handed films that have characters going through an existential crisis and are consumed with thoughts of death. You would think these two films have nothing in common, but I'm dead serious - no pun intended.)When your film has your narrator saying the word ""feminism"" in the first five minutes, you know it's going to be problematic.Now, don't get me wrong. I have no problem with feminism and I consider myself a feminist. Some of my favorite films have feminist characters. I knew going in this film was going to be woke. I just didn't realize how woke till I saw it, which was kind of a disappointment anyway.First off, don't let the cutesy pink marketing fool you. This is not a film for kids, but that happens quite a lot in Hollywood. For example, Drop Dead Fred was a film I saw when I was 10, but it was really for adults. But at least it wasn't woke. I felt kind of sorry for the little girls I saw wearing their pretty pink outfits and dresses knowing that probably much of the preaching against the patriarchy and lack of genitalia jokes were going to go over their heads.Yep. I said what I said. It only gets worse from there.Margot Robbie plays the titular Barbie who lives in Barbieland with all her fellow Barbies that can do it all and have it all. The Kens are kind of just...there. The main Ken played by Ryan Gosling, gets tired of being from friend zoned and taken for granted by Barbie. When Barbie starts to have thoughts of her own mortality, has flat feet, and cellulite, she is advised by Kate McKinnon (one of the few bright spots in the film as Weird Barbie) to go to the Real World to find the girl who's playing with her and make everything right. Ken decides to stow away in Barbie's pink Corvette. Both of them discover the Real World is not what it seems.My biggest problem with this film was the constant preachiness, especially when Barbie and Ken go to the Real World, and it never really stops from there. I resented Greta Gerwig for ""giving the game away"". There's a way to talk about feminism without hammering it over the head and alienating half your audience, in this case men, but I doubt many men will see it. It's like that South Park episode when Randy makes a musical that explicitly talks about oral sex until he is advised to tone it down and hide the message in subtext. That's what Gerwig and her partner Noah Baumbach should have done with the story. This is a film that definitely skews toward a female audience. It needed to be more subtle with the messaging. I would have preferred a fun, silly, colorful Barbie film rather than having a woke agenda pushed on me. Unfortunately, that's the direction Hollywood seems to have embraced these days.However, the visuals were bright, fun, and colorful along with the hairstyles and wardrobe. I liked that they filmed in the Venice Beach Boardwalk and other areas around LA. Despite the diversity of the cast, my mom was unhappy that she didn't see a Hispanic Barbie and Ken (even though we saw a white, black, and Asian Ken). If there were any in the cast, I didn't see them. America Ferreira and her daughter are indeed Latina, but that wasn't enough for her. She does have a point, though, but we could be wrong and missed them. Will Ferrell is wasted as the CEO of Mattel, but I don't care for him anyway, so it didn't really matter that I didn't see him much. Rhea Perlman did have a nice little part as the creator of Barbie, Ruth Handler.This film was very strange and I felt kind of alienated by it. Plus, the last scene of the film was anticlimactic and totally bizarre. I get the good intentions by the filmmakers, but it was way too preachy for me. Legally Blonde was the closest to a Barbie film up until this point and it was a feminist film that never felt like it was preaching to its audience. Elle Woods was a blonde Barbie type character who was underestimated because of her looks, but manages to showcase her intelligence and strength as a successful lawyer without the message of the story becoming too heavy handed and retaining the lighthearted playfulness throughout, which is what Barbie is missing. I think I'll just stick to that film instead.11 out of 17 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",5,Barbie
"As someone said, this is a bittersweet pill. A film that intends to be entertainment and toy marketing, but somehow, it brought tears out of my eyes.I love it. I love everything about it. I love everything it represents: identity crisis, toxic masculinity, and glorifying the value of dolls. Greta Gerwig took an idea that seemed outdated, like ""Barbie,"" to tell a vivid contemporary story. At the very same time, the film also teases itself and all sorts of pop culture. And all the productions-oh my, they are all very pleasing to my eyes and ears.Some that I'm stuck on are the half-jokes/half-seriously tone, which makes the final act not as powerful as it should be. The overexplaining of characters, when they said everything they thought but didn't really show it in another way, and Ken's arc are not completely closure to me.In the end, Billie Eilish's song is the key to winning my heart. Man, that song and that scene are so beautiful.1 out of 8 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8,Barbie
"This movie was everything I didn't know I needed. Was great to just escape from the world for 2 hours. Truly one of the most fun movies I've seen in a while. Fun from beginning to end. Margot was amazing and so was Ryan gosling. 100% recommend for everyone especially if you're a father to a daughter I think it has a Good Message Emmet for all, but especially girls to be what they want to be, and how they can truly be anything. The outfits and stages were amazing. It literally looks like you were at a toy store. I will be surprised if they don't win anything for costumes. I definitely will be buying this movie when it comes out.0 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Barbie is such a fun time, the whole cast collectively deserve an award. Contrary to what some people are already claiming, this is not a men hating film, it is so much nuanced than that. In fact, by the film's conclusion it is clearly demonstrated why extremes wouldn't work, we all need each other and we need to learn how to coexist. I'm so glad this film had something to say. I can tell a certain faction of pea-brained individuals are absolutely gonna seethe when they see this film, and that just make me love it even more. I can't believe a movie like this got such a huge budget and is such a success.31 out of 95 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"I expected this movie to be a quick predictable cashgrab with as much stars as possible for the poster, it turned out to be way more. It has its flaws, but they quickly move past that.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling absolutely killed it. It had great social commentary, while still being funny and wildly entertaining. The design is great, from set design to music to choreography. It's a feast to see all those stars dancing together, and the use of color is amazing.The story was well illustrated, with showing you the message clearly, they sometimes straight up tell you things, but those things are well explained in the context.The real world part didn't stick to its own rules, sometimes it was complete fantasy when it needed to be, and sometimes it was supposed to be ""harsh reality"" which therefore just didn't work. Cliché's and tropes were sometimes a bit too much, but I didn't really expect something else than that. The end-conversation was a bit pretentious, and a bit weaker than it tried to be for me. I could understand that it hit all the right spots for somebody else. The jokes were great, and I laughed a lot. Loved how it looked like the lego movie sometimes.8,2 Well done.

"It was nostalgic, hilarious, esthetically orgasmic and very moving. It covered all generations of Barbie, which was my hands down favorite toy as a kid. It also touched on the female experience in a really welcoming, wonderful way. I felt it included aspects of the male experience that are important as well. Awesome soundtrack, AMAZING SETS, and wardrobes. The cast was amazing, the writing was perfect, such an original, unique stroy line. If you're going to criticize this movie for going ""against your political beliefs"" then you don't deserve this movie anyways. Women are allowed to talk about the female experience and Barbie was a great way to do it! I just saw it 2 days ago and I really want to see it again!!4 out of 13 found this helpful.

"I loved the effort with the sets and the fun outfits. I also really enjoyed the ads threw out movie.I was really enjoying this movie but then it started getting really political, I was kind of fine with it but then they started making politics the whole story line and so it was really no longer a fun movie. After the movie finished I just ended up leaving miserable and like I waisted money... How is a family meant to enjoy this?? I can't see any 13 year old understanding anything they talk about.Also they want to talk about how being a human is hard and that were not perfect but then they hire someone to play a teen girl who has perfect hair and skin.

"I saw it in a theater the day after I saw Oppenheimer and it was a fun movie.I honestly think Margot Robbie is perfect as barbie in this movie. Ryan Gosling as Ken is also good. I think that because of the movies PG-13 rating the movie doesn't target audience aren't kids and there were some violence scenes and Barbie really mentions a lot of death and she has thoughts of dying.The movie opened $155M and I think it's going to reach $1B at the worldwide box office.The things I really liked some of the soundtrack. The soundtrack features Billie Eilish, Ice Spice and Nicki Minaj, Dua Lipa, and so much more singers. I also really loved the song Just Ken by Ryan Gosling. I also loved the idea of making this movie and the director Greta Gerwig is just a great film director from movies such as Lady Bird and Little Women.Some scenes were very boring but I guess it's ok.I just think that you can't compare this movie to Oppenheimer because Oppenheimer is way better.It's a good movie.It's still a good movie and my expect.0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"The Barbie movie was unexpected. It was a colorful and clever ride in the cinema. I was not expecting all the deep emotions that the film gave. Life is not all about perfection, which a lot of people wants to constantly achieve these days, imperfections is what identifies us and that's okay.I'm a visual kind of cinema goer and I have the say that dance sequence (Dance the Night) and the scene where Barbie and Ken where traveling to the real world were AMAZING. Kudos to the creative team behind it, I absolutely adore the set.Greta Gerwig and her team delivered a visual spectacle with a heart.4 out of 20 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I didn't get emotional whilst watching the movie, but hours later when i looked back on how special this movie is for EVERYONE, especially young girls and women.I must have been 8 when i told my mum that i wanted to go on a diet. It's what i saw women doing online and i wanted to be as pretty as they were. Then i grew up and spent so many years being resentful of ""pretty girls"" who i saw daily because they had what i didn't. As a not-conventionally-attractive and disabled woman, i spent days feeling ugly and getting angry at other women and myself because i would never be them or be viewed by other people in the ways that they are. I avoided the mirror for months because i didn't want to see myself. I felt sick looking at my own complexion.It took me years to realise that every girl is a pretty girl. Men will put us down and hate this movie because they don't get it. This movie is a beautiful celebration of what it means to be a woman, to get old, to suffer at the hands of a society which forces us against each other.Gerwig is and incredible writer and director and seems to outdo her genius with every movie she does.8 out of 29 found this helpful.

"I absolutely loved it. Margot Robbie is the perfect stereotypical Barbie. Ryan Gosling gives an Oscar-worthy performance and has a true rock 'n' roll voice. The soundtrack is also very, very good. Subjects of patriarchy and cultural hegemony are approached with humour and historical references. Michael Cera is funnily adorable. Barbie is funny and surprisingly entertaining. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach wrote an enchanting script with genuine emotion. Barbie was brilliantly cast. I loved Ryan Gosling. He's terrific as Ken and delivers an Oscar-worthy performance.

"I have been thinking for 2 days and still I have no idea who the target audience for this film is. The first half of this movie is not bad at all but once Barbie and Ken leave barbieland the movie just completely falls apart. The message shoved in your face way too much and isnt subtle at all, characters that are set up early on are completely forgotten by the 3rd act in a bloated script filled with unnecissarily complex feministic views. For a movie about a children's toy, the dialogue is often much too complex and theres no way in hell a child is going to be able to understand whats going on; several lines left me scratching my head as the dialogue is way too overly complex. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are excellent casting choices with Gosling going above and beyond, nailing all of the comedic moments and elevating all of the material he was given to work with.For a movie I was incredibly excited for, I was severely let down and honestly cannot say I recommend this movie to anyone. If you are going to only see one blockbuster this summer, make it Mission Impossible or Oppenheimer, you are not missing out on much here.48 out of 63 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

Plus, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Simu Liu, and Ncuti Gatwa are all playing Kens. Will Ferrell plays the CEO of Mattel, the company who first brought us Barbie and her Dreamhouse.

The level of detail on the toys, clothes, etc!!If you think it's just a feminist movie, give it a chance, if your smart enough to understand and read into the details, it will make you se a different perspective on what's feminism actually mean.I don't think it's inappropriate for kids however, they have to be certain age to understand the movie!This is already pop culture icon, hopefully opening minds in every generation!1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"Last year I was appointed to a department hiring committee for an important position. When a colleague asked me who else was on the committee, she scoffed at the gender composition. Even though our department is half women, the hiring committee was nearly all men. I hadn't noticed until she mentioned it. What else don't I notice?According to the philosopher Richard Rorty, art is better at changing minds than argument, because it allows the audience to see through someone else's eyes and empathize. In the Barbie movie, shortly after he arrives in the real world, Ken takes a walk through Century City in Los Angeles. Among the skyscrapers there are men in business suits, and a guy exiting a gym nods at him. A couple of guys jump out of a hummer, and policemen ride by on horses. A woman assistant is shushed by businessmen in important discussion. Finally there is a montage of men -- US presidents, movie stars, sports stars, stock traders, Mount Rushmore, and the portraits on US currency. Ken realizes that, unlike in Barbie's world, men hold the power in the real world. Ken learns to sing the 1996 Matchbox 20 hit Push, featuring the lyrics, ""I want to push your around, and I will, and I will."" When the song came out, it was my freshman year in high school. I must have heard it hundreds of times, but I never noticed that the lyrics hinted at violence against the singer's love interest. The film made me notice specific parts of American culture which I had absorbed growing up without thinking, and which reinforced the idea that men have the power in society.The film will work best for an American audience. Not only would it had hit less hard if I hadn't been forced to reevaluate the messages underlying parts of the culture I grew up with, but another wonderful aspect of the film was its send-ups of American films and popular music. The opening to 2001 is ported into the wonderful first minutes of the film. A bit later, a character makes Barbie choose between continuing her fantasy life (represented by a stilleto) and learning the truth (a birkenstock sandel). There is a great musical tribute to Take on Me (I know, a-ha is Norwegian, but it was a US hit!), and a power ballad that reminded me of Free Bird. Later in the film, Ken wears a faux mink coat that I'm sure I've seen on Logan Paul. I must have missed many more.It is surprising that Mattel signed off on the film, since it does a good job of presenting the good, the bad, and the weird of Barbie over the years. While she started out in a swimsuit, Barbies were sold in the getup of just about every profession. Girls could play with Barbie the surgeon, Barbie the scientist, or Barbie the politician, and maybe imagine themselves in those traditionally male roles. On the other hand, a teenage character points out that Barbie has given unrealistic body and beauty ideals to generations of women, and that Barbie promotes unhealthy consumer culture with all of her outfits and accessories. If nothing else, the color profile of Barbie is pink and glittery. The weird are all the discontinued barbies -- including ""Growing Up Skipper"", a doll with inflatable breasts.I nicked one star because of the constant product placement and the milquetoast feel-good ending. That said, the movie is worth your time. After years of copy-paste superhero movies and CGI spectacles, the Barbie movie gives me hope for a future of more thoughtful Hollywood blockbusters.1 out of 8 found this helpful.

"I went in with my sister who grew up watching animated Barbie movies since she was a kid like ""Barbie: Princess Charm School"" or ""Barbie: Princess and the Popstar"" or ""Barbie: Rapunzel,"" etc. I was excited, but more for her, because I know how much Barbie means to her. But sadly, she and I were very disappointed.Like to my sister, Barbie means something to girls everywhere, teaching the important and necessary values aimed at women, and giving them a role model to look up to. But after seeing this movie I can't tell you what Barbie stands for.In ""Barbie"" Margot Robbie's character is called a ""fascist"" and a terribly unrealistic image of a perfect woman. Ken is emasculated, fed sexist stereotypes and turned into a joke. The rest of the other Barbies are manipulative and standard feminist archetypes.I'm not political, but there's an obvious message the writers are pushing here. And it's not subtle at all. Men are worthless and Barbie's unique femininity is problematic.The best thing about the film is its wonderful costume design and special effects. But sadly, that's about it for ""Barbie.""5 out of 6 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",5,Barbie
"From the get-go, Barbie hits hard with its spectacle and wit. The movie literally starts and ends itself in quips. But make no mistake, there is purpose and feeling to the film. It presents its core message boldly around its character's struggles, and subtly beneath its self-referential humor.I could best describe Barbie as the inaugural Marvel movie of Greta-Gerwig-involved projects. It has a fantastic ensemble all-star cast with added cameos you never saw coming. Dazzling VFX and detailed practical set pieces bring life to the most plastic aspects of Barbieland. At several points it not just breaks the fourth wall, but blows through it altogether. There is no moment where it won't reset your expectation about what will come next.There are definitely characters and relationships I would have liked to see explored more in-depth in the film. Regardless, Barbie will send you home with a profound motivation to re-explore who you are, where you're headed, who you want to be.4 out of 29 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"This movie is nothing like I expected AND I LOVE IT. Greta strikes again with the best combo of comedy and drama. I laughed, I almost cried and it was just the best experience.Having moments when I just loved seeing the interpretation of the Barbie world, moments that shocked me of how well they described the patriarchy even through jokes, the moments showing the women maturing and growing up that almost made me cry. There was nothing I didn't love about this movie and I can't stress this enough.Overall, this movie made me fell more empowered and confident than ever and I wish that everyone could have the same experience that I did.4 out of 11 found this helpful.

"Barbie was a big surprise for me, I enjoyed every sip of this delicious pink drink that teleports you to a bright world where imagination is real and reality is just a tiny dreamland nowhere and everywhere. The production design was out of this world and the casting of this movie was perfect, every frame was shot and directed beautifully, in general, the technical aspect was brilliant. Still what impressed me the most was the writing! Greta and Noah wrote a masterpiece film that explores while criticizing the good, the bad, and the ugly in the flaws of human nature in the eyes of Barbie and Kent in their fun adventure in the real world and the imaginary one. What was outstanding in this fun ride is the ability to combine all these meaningful feelings and emotions in one movie in a light sarcastic theme and not forget to present the real issues in our world nowadays and the conflict while analyzing the diverse ideologies that clash in this mess, all of this was done through an objective talented lens.18 out of 52 found this helpful.

"The most fun I've had at the cinema in a long time. The jokes are meta and hilarious. The performances all through spectacular. This was like a fever dream and I can't wait to take all my friends to the cinema to watch this movie again and again. I did not expect to be so entertained but also shedding tears. A movie everyone should go and watch. And how beautiful that Billie Eilish song was! We will definitely hear it live next year at the Academy Awards, where I hope Greta and the whole team will get recognition for creating this (already) iconic film. Production design, script, directing, acting (especially Ryan bodied that role) and Best original song I would want to see awarded.22 out of 69 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Firstly I'll say that I'm the movie's target audience: a female in her 20s. Even though the movie touched some subjects like the fact that a lot of girls grew up with Barbies and felt very insecure about their bodies (which I 100% agree with), and the right to choose what you want to be in your life, it felt uncomfortable; it felt as if all men in the movie were emasculated. In the world of barbie all Kens were uncomfortably stupid and only served for comedic purposes. I won't give spoilers but in this ""perfect"" barbie world you would expect that they would achieve true gender equality since not only Barbie but the Ken dolls are also doctors, scientists, politicians etc etc.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling went above and beyond; I enjoyed their performances. Some scenes were also very funny but personally I did not like the ending.41 out of 60 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",2,Barbie
"It's a good movie. Walking out of it I knew people wouldn't like it considering we rarely have a women's actual point of view in cinema. It's actually quite funny seeing people's reactions to it as if everything that we were showed in the 2 hours of the movie isn't true.In my viewing people were clapping, laughing and crying. It's touching and I'm sure many will relate wether people want to admit to it or not. (This movie isn't about a perfect doll)That being said if you don't like musicals you might not love this movie there are quite a few numbers in this film. Not bad ones just some are abit longer than I'd like.Overall I'd watch again and I've never actually owned a Barbie 👍🏼1 out of 1 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I am not a huge Barbie fan. I want to say that right out of the gate. My mom, however, has a massive collection. She was at just the right age when the dolls came out that Barbie was a huge part of her life. Knowing that, I took her to see Barbie yesterday morning.Parents of young children, there's nothing majorly inappropriate going on but you may want to wait on this one. While it's visually stunning, I wouldn't call it a kids movie. There are lots of complex themes woven into it that younger kids may not understand.Production design is stellar! In scenes where some of the infamous Barbie dream house is involved, the props behave just like Barbie toys do. It's a subtle reminder that the team understood the assignment & did not disappoint.The costume design is also amazing. There are joking references to costumes that were discontinued that fans of the toy line will enjoy. The end credits also do a great job of referencing deep cuts in the Barbie lineup.Diversity is on full display here & it works to the film's advantage. Girls & women watching this film will find a Barbie that looks like them. And gents, they didn't forget you either. There are also diverse Kens in Barbieland. In fact, I'm going to have trouble watching Kingsley Ben-Adir in Secret Invasion as Gravik, because he makes a great Ken. The whole point is representation. Barbie can be anything. The movie does a great job of driving that home.The marketing mentioned if you loved Barbie or hated Barbie, this is the movie for you. It doesn't shy away from Barbie's detractors. Gloria's daughter delivers a scathing referendum on Barbie's impact on society. But later on Gloria delivers a monologue that had my whole theater cheering when she finished. As a middle aged woman, I related to everything she said. I didn't find it preachy as some have said. It felt heartfelt & reflective of what most women deal with every single day.It's fun. At times, it's plain old goofy. The dance numbers are on point. I don't know what I was expecting but I walked out of the theater still chuckling.It's okay to revel in the fun of it. It's okay to dive into the deeper themes. There were tons of ""Barbies"" & ""Kens"" in my theater, wearing their favorite shade of pink, be it subtle or neon. The fans are all in & even a reluctant movie goer like me can get on board. Lots of laughs with enough real world to make it relatable. One of the better movies I've seen in a very long time.No post credits sequences.7 out of 24 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9,Barbie
"The Barbie movie had a very easy going start with parties, colors, and making fun of stereotypes. It's all very musical-like untill Barbie asks the question about dying which can be seen in trailer.The movie slowly starts to take itself more seriously and when Barbie goes to the ""Real World"" she faces problems that modern woman has. Ken also has to face the ""Real World"" but does it in his own way. It was very cool seeing two characters detached from reality and having completely different view on the world face the ""reality"" and carry themselves with it. It makes the characters more fleshed out which the movie does well, as i've got a feeling that Barbie and Ken in particular are behaving just how they were imagined to since they were first made.Time and Change are factors that are actually displayed through small cameos and at the ending itself, but have a very important meaning and are factors that should be thought about after you watch the movie.Ultimately, the ""agenda"" goes from funny jokes to actual rants towards the end of the movie but it all comes a full circle and sends a strong message.The music and cinematography are very cartoonish and nice, so is the dialogue. The references to other media are very cleverly put throughout the movie as well. The dialogue at the beginning is made to look like kids actually playing with those dolls but facing the reality is actually a very good space for character development, and Barbie used that very good. Even tho some ""agendas"" are pushed throughout the movie, it ultimately sends a good message, and does what Barbie is supposed to do : to inspire girls and make them feel strong for who they are.16 out of 64 found this helpful.

"I had high expextations for this Movie: Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, Perfect Casting, Ryan Gosling and then the First Trailer: Our hopes for this beeing something special were high. Yesterday, I saw the movie. It was so great, just so great, My God. Ken is just it. He is just it. Kenough said. You Just Need to buy a ticket, or two and go See it. Some people might Not understand the Movie, maybe your friends or family sitting next to you dont like it. But that is okay. Because you Just wittnessed something special, a historic moment in movie history and you felt it. You know it for sure. And then Barbie ends and all you want to do is Watch it again. Thank you for Making this movie. I will treasure it forever. Thank you, it was so much fun. This is the kend of My Review.9 out of 39 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"The production and the costume design is absolutely wonderful, same goes to the most of the cast. With beautiful attention to detial, uncluding actual cars and houses that we played with.But the message of ""patriarchy is bad"" seemed to be shoved down your throat too aggressively, with the whole thing seeming a bit misguided and hateful toward men, and i dont believe in battling hate with hate. Dont understand me wrong i am a woman in engineering (world dominated by men), but the concept of feminism is not men vs women and what most feminists strive for is not matriarchal, which the barbie word is. Pinning us against each other is not helpful, as we should work together to reach equality, one cannot work without the other. What could be a wonderful message turned confusing and too strong in my taste.24 out of 35 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",3,Barbie
"Barbie, with a surprising amount of political undertones, will probably be one of the most surprising releases of 2023.The movie showcases both sides of the coin, hyper-femininity and hyper-masculinity, with subtle jabs and character realisations throughout the entire film without becoming exhausting.It's undeniable that Barbie is a female empowerment movie but it's one that everyone can get behind.My only disappointments is that Micheal Cera got a marginal amount of screen time despite being the comedic punching bag, and it would of been nice to spend a little more time in Barbieland.Everyone will have their own take on this screenplay, and it might take a few viewings to understand the messages that the film is trying to provide to the viewer, but by no means is this movie bad.1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"Iconic. The set, the outfits, the decor, the styling was iconic. I loved that the words and tones they used were as if a child was playing with them, but the topics were more serious and meaningful. They gave such a creative and fun spin to everything. I had many moments where I thought ""how did they even come up with all of this"". I like to be positively surprised in a movie and the conversations and jokes were so fun and fitting to the movie and the vibe, everything was well thought of and I could not help but smile every time. It's very extravagant and light and fun. It's not a movie for people who like deep dialogues and dramatic emotions in films. It is meant to be easy to digest, fun, extra and make you smile. I find it a brilliant concept and a refreshing, lightweight movie. I loved it. Very Girly and fun.In one word: iconic.10 out of 35 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"The movie is entertaining, funny and it does touches on more serious topics, there is times that it feels that those topics are too on the face and can ruin the passing but is rarely noticeable.The way that the characters evolution is natural and interesting and I can sympathise with a lot of the characters.Is a fun movie and making a Barbie movie a pg13 is a really risky but innovative way of representing this iconic character Is also really important to notice that the movie because of its nature is going to cause a lot of polarisation and hate, I think that the movie could have been more subtle on delivering the ideology but I understand why they didn't do it.5 out of 17 found this helpful.

"The barbie movie is AMAZING. Like perfect cast, amazing references. Like Taylor swift level of references and Easter eggs. It's so clear that it's been made by women (or majority women) all departments, everywhere I hope it wins awards. I've never felt this way for a movie before but it defs was hyped up for a reason. It's a barbie movie made for everyone but it's not like a typical barbie movie (which I still love) it's so much more, once I heard Billie eilishes new song I knew it was gonna be GOOD and in depth with its story line and it was. The whole team and makers of this movie hit the nail on the head. It's genuinely become my favourite movie.10 out of 35 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I went and saw this with one of my best friends and it was a quite ride. We laughed, we cried, we had a great time! Barbie was definitely one of the best films we've seen all year! This was relatable on so many levels! I personally felt that there really is something in this movie for everybody! It pokes fun at the way society is but does it in a way that makes you really think about how you are living in this world. It has also made me decide to add more color into my everyday life as well! The entire cast was absolutely incredible in making this film both be true to what Barbie is to little girls and what it did for children growing up!1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"I was thinking that Barbie was going to be a light hearted family movie.....it is not. You don't want to take the kids to this movie. I mean that was probably obvious from the trailer, casting and vibe. But if you were looking for a fun movie to take you away from the everyday heaviness...this is not that movie. If you want eye candy and lots of posturing and narrative sequences, then this movie is for you....otherwise I'd say don't go. Greta Gerwigs third directorial outing could have been so much more....sadly it does not live up to the hype. I just don't understand why they can't seem to make enjoyable movies that transport you away anymore.30 out of 51 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",2,Barbie

""" Barbie "", fulfilling the expectations of our childhood dreams.This is the first live-action Barbie movie adaptation based on Mattel's Barbie fashion doll. Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, who go on a journey of self-discovery following an existential crisis.Shimmery pink in the dream world while Barbie and her friends placed lovingly. Barbie Land features detailed replicas at a specific scale to look like life-size toy dolls. The clothes, furnitures, dream house, and background of the movie set are all designed to look like the original toy. Barbie Land's construction almost entirely uses an enchanting pink colour.Greta Gerwig as a director neatly wraps up the complex issues faced by women in society in a fun and easily accessible way.Barbie itself is a representation of all women's hopes and desires to be anything they want, including the right to live free from violence and discrimination, to be educated, to own property, and to vote. In Barbie Land, women rule the worlds.Barbie's casting choices have a specific quality. Barbie's Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling obviously looks perfect. Margot Robbie is a living doll, her face and posture are perfect to play the role of Barbie. Although, Ryan Gosling steals the whole show. Ken looks fun to hang out with.The entire soundtrack of the Barbie movie is very meaningful and upbeat.6 out of 32 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8,Barbie
"""I'm just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us. And if all of that is also true for a doll...""Bro I was so excited just to look at the beautiful painted sets and watch the beautiful Barbies and Kens wear goofy clothes...but this was a deep movie.The seemingly perfect matriarchal world of Barbie has has a sudden setback when the perfectly Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie)'s heels land flatly on the ground.Barbie has to leave Barbieland through a surreal theatrical series of vehicles to wind up in California, where she meets her creators at Mattel and others.Of course Mattel, one of the producers, wanted to paint themselves in a positive light. They probably over-emphasize their importance in the playroom (They assert Barbie was the first doll to not be a baby doll, the first opportunity little girls had to play at being something other than a mother, which I find hard to believe). But there is definitely some honest criticism in the movie of who Barbie is and what she represents. Does Barbie make women feel bad about their bodies? Maybe.There are also a couple very playful moments where it feels almost like it feels when one plays with toys. Made me think of the Lego Movie (Which also had Will Ferrell in it).Then there's the characters. There is humor. There is music. There are of, course, gorgeous people and sets. But most of all, there is self-actualization and growth.I love every line in this film. I keep thinking about it. I've seen the movie twice now and I hope to see it again. Please watch it. Prepare to cry.1 out of 9 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Every one - man and woman, should watch this movie with an open-mind and introspection about current society. Barbie was one of the most real, complex, insightful, trippiest, thoughtful, and educational videos I've watched in a long time. This movie is not for everyone and is definitely not designed for kids due to the much deeper meaning. To get the full experience of the art of the movie, you have to ready to focus and peel all the symbolic layers.I came in expecting a lighthearted, fun, and silly movie like how you expect the stereotypical Barbie brand. But the movie brought so much more depth and substance. Be ready for a rollercoaster of emotions!3 out of 8 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"This movie is a feminist fever dream that teaches young girls that they will never be successful in the world as long as men exist, and that men are horrible, ironically Ken played by Ryan Gosling is the best part of this movie, bringing more laughs than anything else.The movie gets upset at the real world because women don't choose to take on more physical or stressful jobs, and then says that the reason they don't take these jobs is because of men, Men are this men are that, men publicly grope women, every single one, and every woman is perfect no matter how obese or weird they are. It's a waste of time for anyone not watching the movie Ironically, go watch Oppenheimer instead.83 out of 126 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",3,Barbie
"This movie is absolutely amazing! It totally makes you think about the current society and what we really do prioritise and favour. Went into it without knowing what sort of angle they would take, and I was so extremely surprised and pleased with how Greta has done this. I can truthfully say I had a smile on my face for most of the movie, however there was times where tears were also shed due to the meaning of the film. Casting was a brilliant choice, Margot was the perfect fit for Barbie and Ryan a great Ken. Also want to mention that America and Kate did awesome jobs with their characters. A must watch, possibly best movie of the year!10 out of 36 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"As expected ""Barbie"" is A lot of happy fun! 💕 Greta Gerwig is a director I've really come to appreciate & LOVE. Greta is one of the most wholesome filmmakers working today. ""Lady bird"" is my favourite coming of age story in film and similarly, I have to say right off the bat-this film is ridiculously hilarious. Tongue and cheek? Sure. Just exceptionally written characters also. The quirks between Margot Robbie (Barbie) & Ryan Gosling (Ken) are just magic together on screen.Margot is probably the only person to have played ""Barbie"" as she is so perfect in the role with everything she does. Mr Gosling (KEN) is eating up all the screen time and will also have you gasping for air at some of his one liners and facial expressions.I should mention that Issa Rae & America Ferrera are just so awesome a-swell in this world. Now! Having grown up in the 90s and seeing how popular the toys were, I was apart of the ""Barbie"" crazed era in primary school. It's really cool knowing everyone has another summer blockbuster coming that they can be truely excited about. Really hope that everyone can give ""Barbie"" a chance, because it has a lot of HEART.Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" is nothing more then a delightful trip down memory lane, filled with what felt like a stellar cast and production value. Furthermore this film was filled with outstanding characters, dance choreography and musical numbers.9 out of 32 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"The voice over commentary in some parts had me laughing to no end. Most of the Will Ferrel scenes I could have been edited out, they were too campy and distracted from the rest of the movie, fortunately they were few and resigned to the later 1/3 of the movie.To be honest I missed most of the big name actors, however Rhea Perlman was spot on perfect in her role.Margo Robbie and Ryan Gosling were excellent as well, with Ryan giving an overtop hammy performance that allowed Margo to shine as the epitome of what Barbie represents, future possibilities.Kate McKinnon was well cast and delivered flawlessly.A couple scenes were overplayed.As a moderately middle-aged man I might have laughed a little to hard in some places. It was well worth seeing, so much so that I even dressed up as 80s fashion Ken when I went.0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8,Barbie
"When we saw the trailer for this movie I knew that my wife was going to want to see it. I really wanted this to be a fun movie and figured it would poke fun at itself a bit. Ryan Gossling and Morton Robbie did a great job as actors. But they were not given a cohesive script and story line. This movie was all over the place. It was not fun and it never is when you are watching overlong dialog, songs, and dance routines. I'm not sure I can even explain the main storyline of this movie. Is that Barbie wants to be real? Does she want to help the girl, now woman that used to play with her fix the relationship with her daughter. Was it about Ken not wanting to exist as an accessory? Overall, this was not fun, funny and ended up being tedious and actually boring. This is not a movie for little girls and it is not a movie for adults either. This is a really big missed opportunity.6 out of 8 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",3,Barbie
"I went into Barbie with no expectations, only hopes that it would be entertaining, even if the intended audience is pretty young. Well, I was wrong about the age of the intended audience because obviously the intended audience is me and my fellow 80's babies/90's teens! I absolutely loved it and definitely entertained. I laughed, got teary eyed, and even cheered at times. Margot Robbie shined, Ryan Gosling gave me a new perspective on Ken, and the costumes dazzled. The themes, jokes, and one-liners were actually pretty insightful. Barbie Movie is not all pretty fluff and makeup. It's the MOMENT.4 out of 24 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Barbie it's not just a movie about some dolls and perfection. This movie says a lot about everything. In the first seconds of it I thought there wouldn't be something meaningful. I thought it would be some fun movie just to chill while you're watching it. But this movie is a lot more than just fun. With this movie we can see ourselves in it. It shows how powerful women are. But also how hard it is to be a woman. And not just that. Also our childhood. The barbieland is our childhood. Peaceful, enjoying life. But when it's our time to leave it, it's scary and new because that's the adult life. The finale scene shows us that to live is the most beautiful thing we can experience. And some people are stereotypical barbies who don't know how to live their life in the most human way. We are here to smile, cry and improve ourselves. But sometimes we get lost and need to find ourselves again. It's a cycle that we need to go through. This movie represents a lot of things not just one. And I think everyone who watches that film can find a different meaning.0 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"With movies like Everything Everywhere All At Once and Beau Is Afraid having come out recently, Barbie is the next in a line of a clearly developing trend of absurdism, meta commentary, and surrealism to create a wacky, funny, beautiful, and touching film about some type of social commentary. With Barbie, we get commentary on feminism, consumerism, and existentialism. It leans perfectly into its brightly colored world and plasticky fakeness to help elevate its commentary and rich cast. The costume, makeup, and set design are lavishly created and I wouldn't be surprised if it won Oscars for all of these categories. The cast does a fantastic job, and I don't think there could have been a better Ken or Barbie. Greta Gerwig was always going to make this more than just a family movie. It's a feminist masterpiece chock full of over the top pop culture nods, perfectly timed comedic quips, and genuine emotional moments that make you think.3 out of 27 found this helpful.

"Went to the Wednesday Barbie Blow Out showing - I went into it thinking it was going to be a cute charming movie. It wasn't anything I expected, I've never seen a movie like this before, on all levels from writing, the sets. Every actor has such amazing range. The way each scene transformed your mind set, having you want more. This movie was so good It was written with current, real issues while also being nostalgic and filled with Easter eggs, while giving ode to the past and so self aware. The writers and actors perfectly put into a scene the struggles, heartache, dissonance into everyday life, while making you cry of both laughter and sadness.18 out of 79 found this helpful.

I felt like a little kid again at the movies. Totally absorbed with the story. It's a fictional land, while the film is so raw. Margot Robbie is a joy to watch and showed an impressive performance. I believed she was Barbie. The movie is played out as if the characters are dolls being played with.

"First, I can't believe I went to this movie. My 18 year old daughter wanted to go so I said ok. I watched the first 20 minutes in disbelief - with my internal voice asking, ""How did this movie ever get made?"" The story is stupid. The acting is bad. The movie tries to be a cross between The Wizard of Oz, La La Land, Being John Malkovich and The Truman Show but fails on all attempts. Is it a musical, comedy, drama, spoof? Yes to all. But again, it fails miserably on all attempts. Oh - and have I mentioned how we women are supposed to be superior to men? Like the Woo Girls in HIMYM, it's just sad. I'll never get my time or money back, so I recommend you just save your money and go see something else. I just can't believe this film has good reviews. It must me a new way to market films - pay a whole bunch of people to talk it up and write good reviews on social media, and then you'll get the crowds on opening weekend. You've been warned.205 out of 435 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"I went to see Barbie with the highest of expectations and it did not disappoint.At times the whole movie theatre was laughing out loud. It was a beautiful experience to share. And there was even clapping at the end.It does not matter if you are young or old, a man or a woman, this is a movie you will enjoy.Do yourself a favor: leave your judgements aside and go watch it.Brief disclaimer: it is Barbie. It does touch on some controversial issues; considering Barbie always has been a female stereotype. It touches on the place of the woman in the world, the patriarchy, etcetera. I was not prepared for that and I do have some strong personal opinions on the topic itself. That being said: everything was so beautifully done and told and funny I seriously cannot complain about it. I honestly really enjoyed it.1 out of 6 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"This movie was so emotionally moving in a way that I didn't expect at all. I loved how critically it evolves around the Barbie and Ken figure and questions everything you ever took for granted in a very nice and intelligent way. I absolutely loved this movie and would watch it again any time.I sobbed for most half of the movie, at the end it comes down to why it's important to be a human and not trying to be perfect.The cast was also amazing. Great acting. Almost all of the cast of sex education is in it which was really cool to see.

"Barbie movie is a comedy which is based on absurd plot twists and things which happen throughout the film. It offers many laughs and has a lot of hidden jokes which add up to a great movie. I was worried there would be much too many musical scenes, but after watching it I believe they were put there with good reason and in just the right places. The whole scene nearing the end of the film (I won't spoil anyhting, don't worry) was just so well done, I loved that the play on women-male dynamics was very lighthearted, but just serious enough. There is apsolutely no men-bashing.The Ken's were put in the women's places from the Real World and men in the theatres watching saying that the movie is 'too feminist' and is 'men-bashing' are failing to see their hypocrisy.25 out of 88 found this helpful.

"Before I start this review, let me start by saying that I used to be a staunch feminist. I'm certain that once upon a time, this film would have been right up my alley. I would have been nodding along with America Ferrera's infamous 30-min monologue in the second act (was it thirty minutes? It felt like thirty minutes). I would have been cheering when the women finally wrested back power. I would have been disgusted at the instatement of the patriarchy in Barbieland.Now, this sort of narrative tires me, especially when it's so cringy and on the nose. I was expecting true woman power out of this film - a glorification of all that it means to be a woman, especially since Barbie has always been the epitome of femininity. Instead, we have the same repackaged message that being a woman is a torturous, inferior experience, and that you must escape it at all costs. We have the same narrative that men are literal trash and that they will succumb to their basest instincts at first chance.Really, we have the same old, same old: ""Women can do it all"" - we cannot - ""Women don't need men"" - yes, we do - ""Men are asinine, useless, selfish, and egoistic"" - sure, like all women are, if we're making generalizations - ""Loving others by serving them is demeaning"" - serving others is the ultimate form of love and should be uplifted, appreciated, and glorified. Instead, this film shows women in maid costumes to make the point that serving others is h0rribl3!!!11!We were supposed to get a visceral reaction to this image of women as maids - and I did, because it was so artless, cringy, and reductive - and make the connection that the patriarchy enslaves us. What the patriarchy does is simply split labor. Men outside the home, women within. Is that inherently bad? Or does it simply make sense based on men's and women's distinct strengths, at least historically? We must question. You will likely have a different answer than I.I liked some of the messages at the beginning, namely that women are so often subject to impostor syndrome. That was beautiful, but then later on the film takes it upon itself to trample men to ""uplift"" women. I did not feel uplifted. I felt betrayed and pandered to, except I was the wrong crowd. It ignores the hardships of being the dominant sex: Being expected achieve, perform, earn more, lead, provide, protect, wear an emotionless facade. In some respects, women have it easier than men.When America Ferrera, whom I just want say I adore, was doing her monologue on how it sucks to be a woman due to what's expected of us, all I could think was, ""Yes. There are certain expected behaviors of both women and men. It's called basic public decency and decorum.""For instance, men are expected to be dominant and aggressive, but not so aggressive as to be frightening. Men are expected to hide their emotions, but not be emotionless brutes. If we started on this route, we could pick apart just about anything.This sort of monotone, flat representation of our complex human experience works well to get a crowd fired up, but it's ultimately reductivist. I walked away feeling like the director thought I was stupid.What I did like was the aesthetic, the much more subtle commentary on American consumerism, and the representation of teenagers are oversensitive militants. That's it.18 out of 23 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",3,Barbie
"Never have i seen a film on the silver screen as loud and as proud of its feminist message as Barbie. Most movies half ass it, you can put the same recycled messages that are surface level in meaning and still pander to the male audience, cause no one's gotten the guts to actually give us a film with a story and characters that's truly for women. But that's just what Greta Gerwig does. This film wonderfully balances comedy and emotion, you'll be laughing as much as you'll be crying, especially if the message of this film speaks to you. A colorful set design devoted to capture the accuracy of playing with barbie dolls, a beautiful collaboration between several female artists, empowering the film's core of exploring one's identity as a woman in a male dominated society, and the talent of the film's lead actress, Margot Robbie along with the rest of the cast ties this film together into Movie of The Century.My one critique on the film is that i find by that end of the film it was a bit too apologetic to its male characters. While it didn't diminish the film's core, I felt Barbie's message could've been amplified far more if they were less forgiving as the film shines light on the double standard placed on women, barbie doll or human.Nonetheless, this movie is simply excellent. I found myself as a trans person who has went through his own existential crisis and struggle with identity coming out the theaters extremely happy with my barbie dolls from my childhood with me. Never would i thought i would find a film that spoke to me on such a personal level as many have.3 out of 8 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9,Barbie
"The theatre was filled to the brim with 99% women and girls wearing pink, we felt united in the moment of watching such a beautiful film. It's a comedy but it also offers a glimpse into the real world and what it's like for girls and women daily. It was beautiful and i can only wish for more people to go and see it. The laughs and the jokes were only a small portion of the emotions we felt we could just let out, it was emotional in the best way possible and was a moment that i am thankful i could share with my bestfriend. Directors like Greta Gerwig are what we need in this world for it to be complete.5 out of 14 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"A great film that shows both the hardship of real life and the beauty of life. Great film and unexpected .I would highly recommend for any viewer , I felt the corny dancing and the meaningful actions made for a great cocktail.I went with a mixed group of different ages and everyone enjoyed the film. Some found it meaningful and some found it comedic and slapstick.The cast was one hundred percent perfect and I can't imagine a different Ken or Barbie. Ryan gosling played his part superbly and you could at times relate to his character and other times laugh at his mid fortune and dance routines.Overall a great film.2 out of 7 found this helpful.

"I found this to be a mixed bag.First up, when I walked into the cinema I expected there to be lots of young Barbie fans - there weren't more than a handful. The audience was a real cross section. Probably the majority were females - just. People of all ages from a few young girls through to pensioners - with lots in the teeneager to late 20's group. Lots of people wearing pink.This is the first time I can remember since Terminator 2 where I couldn't go to the screening time I wanted as it was sold out for my two first choices (in the day time).I was expecting a high camp movie that works on both levels - young kids and something for the adults. Thats not really what we got. This is not a kids movie. The group of kids sat near us were visibly bored after the first half an hour. Its a 12A for a reason. There seems to be a perception that this movie is for little girls waving Barbies around - it isn't.The first half hour has all the camp stuff, setting the scene, adults acting as dolls, funny Barbie world-isms, etc.Then it changes when America Ferrera and her joy-sucking teenage daughter are introduced. It stops being so much fun. The central message of the film is then clumsily hammered home with no subtlety for the rest of the movie - taking the viewer out of Barbie world. Its message is also delivered inconsistently.The final joke of the movie does not hit home very well and seemed a bit unnecessary.With the above criticisms, heres the mixed bag bit - it was very funny in places. We laughed out loud lots, but seemed to be the only people in the 3/4 full theatre laughing. Its also very clever in places - like the discontinued Barbies.Ryan Gosling is excellent. Will Ferrell is hilarious. Michael Cera is good. Others are confusing (Rhea Perlman's character...). I expected more from Ncuti Gatwa - given he is the new Dr Who.Some very amusing musical numbers.It felt a little long. Would have made a nice 90 minute movie.2 out of 2 found this helpful.

"We saw a pre-screening of the Barbie movie last night. I loved the walk down memory lane and some new facts about the history of Barbie scattered through the film. There were great messages around what feminism really is but also how when one gender holds all the power it's not a good balance. The actors were brilliant and Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken was just perfection. Margot Robbie made the perfect ""stereotypical"" Barbie but took us on an emotional ride of discovery. All in all it was an enjoyable movie with a great script. Great for Barbie fans and anyone who has a connection to Barbie from their childhoods!14 out of 74 found this helpful.

"I'm sorry if there are some mistakes in this, english isn't my first language. This is seriously one of the funniest movies i've ever watched. I laughed everytime Ryan Gosling was on screen, he was my favorite in this movie. The only thing i would say wasn't the absolute best was the storyline. I felt like it was like 3 stories all in one movie and they shifted to those stories really fast. I did like the feminist vibe because it was all without hating on men. I think this would be a perfect movie for everyone. In my theater it was mostly young females tho, but i don't think it's made only for them!5 out of 15 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"For a movie about a line of plastic dolls, it managed to be the most deeply human movie to come out in a while. I've don't think that I've walked out of theater at the end of a movie with the feeling of so much solidarity with the folks around me and I'm already trying to make a plan for seeing it again in theaters.From the huge amount of artists work that went into making intricate sets that had the feeling of big Broadway ensemble stage pieces to the soundtrack, I can't say enough good things about this movie. Go see it, take your teenagers or your mom, but Greta Gerwig went and made something really special.18 out of 82 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"I went into this movie thinking it would be a mature twist on the classical Barbie figure and the 'ideal' life of Barbie & Ken, as Barbie related content is usually known for.I was however quite surprised with the depth of the themes in this movie. The themes of gender equality and femininity were touched on in a very observant and interesting fashion, not necessarily pushing any agenda but instead giving the viewer their own opportunity to make their mind up and think a bit. Despite the serieus themes, the movie is very funny and gives a lot of big and small nudges to the Barbie franchise and history. It's remarkably weird at times, but in a good way.The acting by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is great, as well as by a lot of the side characters. The set designs are also amazingly done and give the movie a nice feel. The audience was very hyped up and clapped or screamed on multiple occasions, improving the cinema experience on our visit at the opening night as well.Would definitely recommend a cinema viewing!11 out of 50 found this helpful.

"Just as they did with White Noise (based on a phenomenal book by Don DeLillo, btw), Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach take an existing cultural institution which already possesses immense iconic satirical qualities and overwhelmly trash it with unnecessary hokey jokey business. (See the final supermarket so-called dance scene in White noise - itself lifted from a far better version in the final scene of the Japanese remake of Zatoichi). This couple should run a torture garden for a spy agency: they have such an immense grasp of the obvious, they will pummel your senses to smithereens. You will never recall when the Jokers grin of insane happiness was not permanently distorting your lips. What have we done to deserve this? You name it. At least they didn't cast Adam Driver as Ken.38 out of 90 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie

"The movie did something that has never been done before. The details, the music, comedy, and my favourite.... the outifts!!! I could have never imagined that a movie with such entertaining characters and plot could be made based on a Barbie. I truly reccomend you warching this film, not only it is entertaining, but it reminds you how great it is to be independed and how to stay true to yourself. The movie also highlits the importance of talking about your emotions and how holding them im might lead to something worse.I have no doubt that this is the best Greta Gerwig's movie yet and I hope in the future she will spoil us with more fascinating stuff.6 out of 28 found this helpful.

"A breath of fresh air from almost all movies made in the past 10 years. Great acting, amazing set designs and a wonderfully interesting story with a few twists! I've been so turned off with many of the movies made in the past 10 years due to poor storylines, and an extreme over abundance of CGI, which I'm guessing most people like because that's the bulk of movies nowadays. This movie had me smiling or laughing most of the time, with a few heartfelt moments which brought a tear or two to my eyes. Congratulations to the writer, producer, Director and cast as it was an amazing movie all around - loved it.6 out of 39 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Storyline: 8.5- Great story, could've been fleshed out more in some areas to have an even better overall connection; nonetheless, it still has a great plot, conflict, climax, etc. A little silly at times; but, it is a movie about Barbie. Pacing was good and easy to follow. It is, in my opinion, just about the perfect movie length at an hour and 54 minutes.Cinematography: 8.75- There are some really great cinematic shots throughout the film. Clear distinction between ""Barbie Land"" and ""The Real World"". Good angling on all characters.Acting & Costumes/Makeup- 9.75- The acting was wonderful. Every actor pulled their weight and shined. Many comedic moments that will have you laughing nearly to tears. Also, very serious moments that are executed well in such a way that may bring you to tears. The costumes & makeup were beautiful.Music Soundtrack: 9.5- Overall, extremely strong movie soundtrack. All of the songs align with the theme of what is happening during the current scenes & the storyline. The weakest song (and I mean from a vocal standpoint) is the one sung by Ryan Gosling.Choreography- 9- There is a fair amount of choreography in the film, and there is an all-ken dancing scene that is phenomenal.Overall: 9.1. This movie is PG-13 for a reason. There are lots of mature references. It is a movie made for adults, not kids. Definitely worth a watch, though, so go see it!1 out of 14 found this helpful.

"Didn't know what to expect... was pleasantly surprised. Clean humor that honored the struggles of women internally as well as those who feel displaced culturally in the US. Liked that it spoke the the variety of people and our roles in society. Was a reminder those thatsuffer struggle, sticking together, through intelligence, compassion and communication can make the world a better place and can be an amazing support structure. It encouraged acceptance of people with differences, people that don't look like you and challenged the battles over ""what's feminine"" or ""what's masculine"" (after all Barbie and Ken have no genitals).11 out of 69 found this helpful.

"Barbie is a very good start movie-try to popularize the feminism idea to normal people. Many people just lack a point or we can say a chance to touch such idea. After watching this movie, I realized that men all over the world love to be fathers and love to preach. Women, as the party being objectified, are always in the status of the object being stared at. When I saw ""Let me show you"" in the movie theater, all the girls laughed, and this kind of resonance for a long time was very exciting lol. The biggest surprise was the tribute to 2001 at the beginning of the film, which I loved. It is a good moral that civilization evolves when all women wake up.13 out of 58 found this helpful.

"Barbie represents opression of women all around the world ruled by men. Ken represents manhood without capitalism or without a genital... blah blah blah...This movie should not have been a political satire. It should have been a fantasy romance comedy musical such as Entangled or Disney movies. I left the movie theater after its first 30 minutes so if this one didn't turn out to be a masterpiece in the remaining 1:30 hour of its runtime I had much more funtime wandering under hot sun than watching Barbie...Robbie and Gosling are as good as they could get with this absurd writing and directing.My rating is 3 only for the sake of its starting level production staff, PA, Gathering servants who worked for minumum union wage.10 out of 17 found this helpful.

But the whole cast did such an amazing job too.The movie has comedy and touches of musical. Its a complete surprise. I would definitely watch it again.If you are undecided and you think this is a kid movie. It is not. And it is worth the tome.

"A pink lovers dream really,I sat down at this film with nothing but open mindedness and a slight sense of uncomfortableness as being one of the few men in seated at the showing.However leaving this film I was filled with a great sense of joy, a near two hour course of fun, laughter and adult themes to make this a great film. Could a child watch this for the sake of it purely being Barbie? Yes. Could an adult enjoy this and understand the true meanings of the film? Yes!Without giving any spoilers away Greta Gerwig delivers a fun filled adventure with mature enough themes to open the eyes of many film goers to see what is really out there happening in todays world and this a pure reflection of that formatted in a way that all can enjoy.A seemingly fully invested enable cast bring the life and soul to this film, Gosling seemingly carrying this film on his back and Margot's performance was also good enough.The cinematography and stage design for this was exactly how you would imagine and provide a great backdrop to this film, The musical numbers and art style were in complete sync boosting the film to wild heights.Some tough, touching and some frankly weird scenes (The very end) left me feeling great overall and its certainly a film I would see again and one I would recommend.1 out of 7 found this helpful.

"Just amazing and a spectacular film for everyone of all ages. The cast and direction of the film were amazing! The set pieces and art direction was inspired. Additionally, the script was air tight and very funny. I cried and laughed throughout the film. I truly believe the movie will become a classic. The only reason it lost a star was because of some of the loose ends of the plot in the film. Overall the film was a great movie going event and extremely rewarding. I think Gerwig is very good at subverting audience expectations which makes the film more engaging. I would recommend this movie for everyone.1 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I've just taken 2 nieces, 9 and 14, to see Barbie. They both hated it... really, really hated it!! And, me: I'm just stunned. I've no idea what I've just seen.If Barbie is meant to be a dark satire, it's alright. If it's meant to be a kids movie, it's unconscionably bad. And, I'm totally confused which type of movie it's supposed to be. What the literal heck is going on!!If you're looking for a twenty first century dark cultural satire, you're at least in your twenties, you've an open mind, this is your movie... maybe. If you're looking for a movie to take your kids to, before getting ice cream, this is absolutely not the movie you're looking for. My advice: give Barbie a miss and go straight for the ice cream. You will be so much happier. I wish I had.11 out of 19 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",3,Barbie

"I swear to god this movie is one of the best i've seen this year. My expectations were high BUT NOT THAT HIGH. I'm not sure if this movie is good for small kids, they may not understand the problems this film addresses. I'm really happy that this movie was created because we should talk more about this problem (I don't wanna say what is this problem coz it would be a spoiler and i want you guys to have a surprise). And seeing Ryan Gosling in this role is something i would never expect to see. We know Ryan from all those mysterious and dark action films so seeing him dancing in colorful clothes and doing all these crazy stuff is incredible. I love this man and I love him even more now, i'm so grateful that he took part in such a great project that addresses such a huge problems.

"This movie is the definition of camp and fun cinema that also makes you think. I don't think I've ever laughed as much and for so long as I did when I was in the theater watching this movie. This movie is one of them where before you've even finished watching it the first time around you know you are gonna be coming back to watch it again and again. I remember watching all of the trailers and teasers and being so excited for this movie but also scared, because this could have either be the greatest movie ever or the worst movie ever. And of course it was the greatest movie ever. I highly recommend to anyone who wants to just have fun and laugh for the 2-hour run time (that flew by super quick).15 out of 92 found this helpful.

"With all the hype around this film, my expectations were high and were initially met. The film begins as a self-aware, lighthearted critique of its own legacy but, as Barbie steps her flattened foot into the real world, transcends into a clumsy story on gender inequalities. Whilst funny and original at first, it doesn't take long to notice the repetition of the same jokes that were introduced in the initial minutes of the script, as the film transitions into a full-blown battle of the sexes. Despite these flaws, the casting is well-executed, with Ryan Gosling delivering a brilliant performance as Ken. Unfortunately, even his portrayal is unable to compensate for the deficient plot.65 out of 102 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",5,Barbie
"This movie was amazing both in the commentary it set out to say and the jokes. I'm not gonna beat around the Malbui dream house, the casting was on point and the references to some of the more obscure Barbie lore was appreciated. Ken also has some pretty fun scenes as well.Now listen I've already seen reviews about how some people aren't happy about the commentary in the movie. Well guess what maybe that's the issue then. We have movies about war but that doesn't mean we are saying war is good. Overall I think there are alot of people who wanted this to be a comedy so bad that they missed the very obvious signs in the trailer that it was going to be more then that. The comedy is there to soften the slap of reality that yes women are still objectified and they aren't going to sugar coat it.If this movie pisses you off because you think the plot is ""men bad, women good"" then you missed the point of Ken's story line and how he grew as a person. Grow up and learn to see beyond your 'Barbieland' where everything it's perfect for you cause it's not.12 out of 59 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9,Barbie
"Yes, this film receives my seal of being a yes film, passing all enjoyment factors. It has a) entertained me, b) made me laugh or cry and c) did not cause me to break the cycle of evolution and retract back into an amoeba. Factor c) may be triggered by rather an overload of cringe, a failure of the Bechdel test, a lack of overall slay, bad child acting or the most important, the inclusion of slander of any of the gorlz (Margot Robbie, Jennifer Lawrence, Taylor Swift, Florence Pugh, Kristen Stewart, Meryl Streep, Paul Mescal, Greta Gerwig, Stanley Tucci, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jamie Lee Curtis, *)*The list of gorlz is ever growing and may only be influenced by my opinion.0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"I saw this movie opening night and my expectations were beyond met and exceeded the limitations of what I thought a good movie was. It was one of the best movies I've ever seen. I was moved completely and entirely. I laughed, I cried, and I left the movie changed. It is a masterpiece. For those who don't understand, I highly recommend watching the movie again. The writing, the characters, the set, and the outfits were so brilliantly curated. I do not even hesitate to say it is now one of my favorite movies and one of the best movies I have EVER seen. Greta Gerwig is nothing less than a genius and deserves ALL of the recognition. The casting was perfection. The meaning behind the movie holds a special place in my heart and EVERY SINGLE PERSON NEEDS to see this movie. My favorite part of the movie was not ONLY the movie itself but the effect it is having on the communities surrounding it. The collective unspoken rule of dressing up to go see this movie. Brilliant.The conversations surrounding this movie is essential to have.I recommend to every single person. Greta Gerwig is brilliant.3 out of 14 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

It transfers us to whole new magical world and you will enjoy every single second of it while makes us relate to ourselves and our real world problems, emotions and situations. Filled with powerful performances and soundtracks. A instant classy, Must Watch. Margot Robbie owns the role Barbie. She lives the character. Ryan as Ken is so great. He does really steals the show sometimes. All the others supporting characters and human characters are so good and fun too.Barbie movie really respects it's roots and pays a beautiful tribute to all Barbie dolls and it's creators.1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"I just saw the barbie movie this day and in a few words I can say that it exceeded my expectations that I had about this movie.First of all, the performance of all the characters in general is more than decent, and I also feel that it had a perfectly planned plot, since I consider that no scene is out of context or just filler, which is something that happens very often in movies these days.Also another aspect to highlight is that the film in general is still entertaining for audiences of all ages, since it contains humorous phrases and references that make the film more attractive to people.Finally, the main reason why I liked this film so much was that it leaves you with a very deep message, since this film touches on very sensitive issues that represent the defects of the human being, and this film leaves us a message that we are all equally important and that we must not let ourselves be carried away by society's stereotypes.1 out of 5 found this helpful.

"When I first walked into the cinema to watch this movie my first expectation is just for it to be funny and fun pink bling bling stuff but I should've expected a more deeper meaning to this movie when it's a Greta Gerwig movie.And what even more interesting about this movie is when you watch this at the first half you would think it is solely about woman empowerment and stuff but at the end it really does explain about man's feeling and insecurities as well. The introduction of patriarchy towards Ken is such an amazing and fun scene to watch. Ryan gosling is such a good actor to play the himbo role since you can enjoy his character despite how he portrayed the toxic masculinity role so well.But I wanna focus more on my point of view as a woman myself here. Watching this movie as someone who's childhood revolves around Barbie doll brings so much nostalgia and make me realize how it plays a huge part in my journey as a woman. The transitions from being a little girl to a woman is spot on. It touches about insecurities and the man's expectations of a woman and many more crucial problems.It is so woman empowering and the message is quite obvious and delivered pretty strongly and straight forward in the scripts. But I couldn't deny the scriptwriting really touches my heart and makes me wanna cry. But i still wish it was being potrayed and conveyed more subtly as it will be more fun for viewers to interpret the message itself but I understand that this Barbie movie's targeted audience could be from all range of age so the message should be crystal clear.It's just some people might think that this movie is solely forcing an agenda. Like as a woman I get this whole messages but for someone else it might be coming off to strong and seems pretty stereotypical feminism BS which is a hard pill to swallow but we all know certain people in our society will have that kind of opinion when they saw the movie. That's why I wish it comes more naturally, thats all. But I think the ending make up the whole strong message about feminism earlier with how its was not just about that.Like I said the movie also touches about the whole experience as a human no matter what their gender are and how we're flawed but that's just what life is.3 out of 27 found this helpful.

"Go and see it with neutrality. It is not a movie exclusively for the female audience. I have fully appreciated the way in which certain topics are addressed, such as Capitalism and Patriarchy, the stereotypes of being an attractive Woman and the problem about the toxic masculinity. At the moment it is the film that most surprised me, positively, of 2023. There's a special chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie, since, when they appear together in the first scene till the last one, and when you note this detail you cannot think : ""Damn, they're so gorgeous!"".Would recommend it!!!!!!0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"Went into this movie knowing it'd be hilariously awkward. Robbie as Barbie and Gosling as Ken. Also a great supporting cast including Ferrell, Cena, Cera, Ferrera, Liu, McKinnon, just to name a few. It was thoroughly entertaining but a few segments were a bit too preachy on feminism, but that's to be expected when it's a Barbie movie. This film had great costume and set designs and will win Oscars for those two categories for sure. It will most likely be nominated in all the major categories. My only hope is that this destroys Mission Impossible at the box office so we can witness Barbie defeating Tom Cruise. Worth a watch and probably a re-watch once it goes up for rent digitally.0 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8,Barbie
"I'll start with the issues, because overall this movie was enjoyable if you don't take it too seriously.The majority of the movie is a lighthearted comedy. The biggest tool a comedy has to use for conveying societal criticisms is satire. The beauty of satire is that you can make some really good points. When the movie used satire to make it's points it was great. But the 5% of the time that it forgot about the comedy altogether and tried to take itself too seriously (I'm not saying the subject itself matter wasn't serious) conflicted with it's own tone. You can make all the points you want to make with a biting satire without stomping on your own tone.The ending for Barbie was felt misguided. Without spoiling it, there's a point between when the final conflict is resolved and the very last scene of the movie where barbie experiences something. It looks like the scene is supposed to be deep and insightful, but it honestly felt like the writers got to that point in the movie and didn't know how to end it, so they just kinda piled on some abstract feelings and vague phrases for a transition. Sort of like a high schooler writing an essay and not knowing how to write a concluding paragraph.The middle school girl character is a 1 dimensional character, but writing young children characters seems to be a challenge for Hollywood so you can't blame them too much. And lastly the whole car chase scene was a blatant Chevy ad to the point that it was almost funny itself.Now the good: The visuals and characters were all done really well, and not just Robbie and Reynolds but the rest of the cast. The movie itself was really entertaining and worth a watch.0 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8,Barbie

"Barbie is a film with undeniably gorgeous production design and distinct visual charm, and it's at its best when it embraces its surreal absurdist humor and runs with it. This has some of the funniest sequences of the year.Robbie, Gosling, and most of the rest of the cast have impeccable comedic timing. The line delivery is somehow both dry and full of energy.The world that the story presents is gleefully ridiculous and when it fully leans into this tone, it's wonderful.The problems arise when the script fluctuates wildly (and frequently) between goofy dumb comedy and heavy-handed social messaging. It's jarring and often seems to be treating us, the audience, like we're stupid.The script is so heavy-handed in presenting a shallow view of the world and reductionist view of both men and women, yet is seemingly so convinced of its intelligence and wit.A caricatured world is all good and fun, but it's not exactly conducive to making a commentary on incredibly nuanced issues.Thankfully, the film sort of figures out how to balance all of this by its final minutes, and it really does have a knockout ending.There's a lot to love here. It's just kinda messy in delivering the good stuff.14 out of 29 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",5,Barbie
"After watching the trailers, promotional materials and interviews I had very high hopes for this film, especially when looking at Greta's other work. I was not disappointed.I went to see it at the cinema with my partner the first weekend of its release, and before I had even sat in my seat I was already impressed. Over half the audience were families with young children, dressed up and holding their own barbie dolls. The rest were couples, older people, groups of young lads, and friends. The majority of the audience were sporting pink, and there was a real buzz of excited chatter in the air that I can not recall ever experiencing to this extent before a film. I think this is a testament to the entire creative team, to manage to produce so much excitement among so many different types of people is a feat I have not personally witnessed accomplished in my entire adult life.The opening scenes were outstanding. The introduction to barbie struck me on an emotional level, and perfectly set up the characters of the film. The introduction to Barbie left me reminiscing of my own childhood experiences of playing with the dolls, and managed to perfectly capture the excitement that was to come.I really enjoyed how some things were left unsaid, and your imagination had to do the groundwork. In a film made to appeal to both children and adults, often most aspects are over explained and nothing is left up to interpretation, yet Barbie managed to ask questions it did not provide complete answers for, whilst still maintaining accessibility for its entire audience.It had some really imaginative sequences and routines that ensured the film had constant sparkle. The choreography and set design complimented these aspects beautifully.There were really touching moments on humanity, feminism, society and relationships, without villainizing Ken (Men), which would have been an easy cop out.It was also oozing with comedic value, Robbie and Reynolds were hilarious, and brought a youthful exuberance to their respective roles. None of the jokes fell flat, and there were many moments where I was laughing out loud in the cinema.I will say that the casting of the mother and daughter did not feel as strong, and that there were some scenes of product placement that felt really forced and did briefly take me out the film.Additionally, I felt the film did not really know how to finish its story, and the last 30 minuets were weak compared to the rest of the movie.Despite these criticisms, I absolutely adored the film. A more honest reflection would probably lead me to score it 8, however, personally, the relationship I had with Barbies in my own childhood strengthened my appreciation for the film.It was funny, touching, exciting all whilst being really quite sad. I laughed and I cried.I would recommend this film to anyone, as I feel that all people going to see it with an open mind will find that they authentically enjoy it.Thank you Greta, for taking me back to my own childhood, and capturing those big questions that begin in our youth on the big screen.1 out of 8 found this helpful.

"I love Greta Gerwig so I knew I'd love this. It, however, exceeded my expectations and was a movie so great it broke through my expectations and my version of the real world. I will see this again as many times and with as many people or by myself that I can. This is one of the greatest films not only of the year, but of the decade, if not the century. If I sound like I'm over exaggerating it, for me, I am completely serious. Please go watch it with your mom, your dad, your lover, your sister, your brother, your best friend, or your worst enemy. It's worth it, it really really is. Bravo!!!!!!!1 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"So good, the emotions, the reality and how it came together as a live action BARBIE film was perfect and outstanding which is good for adults as well as children. I am so impressed how well this was pulled off and the details from the outfits to the design of the sets was outstanding. There was laughing and crying in this film and which relates to everyday life and having all the different barbies was brilliant! My favourite has to be the weird BARBIE because I definitely relate to her more! I recommend watching this and giving it a go because you may think oh it's just a kids film but once you've watched it, it's not what you expect and I'm itchy to watch it again!5 out of 29 found this helpful.

"Acting is good, Margot did an amazing job at portraying Barbie even though Ryan as Ken absolutely stole the show to be honest. Humour wasn't amazing but it was still good enough to make me laugh a few times. Plot is slightly messy, not horrible, like I get it but the movie didn't really dive into anything too deep either in my opinion but at least it does mention some important subjects. Another thing that bothered me was the waste of Will Ferrell's character who could have been a better ""villain"" that simply an incapable clown. I still very much enjoyed this movie and think the movie still works because it's execution, cool idea and good acting but needed a bit more complexity and maybe a better written villain with actual motives in order to become a ""masterpiece"".1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"Definitely not understanding why this movie was over hyped. What age demographic is this movie for exactly? It's not a movie for little kids. Maybe pre teen girls? And I can't understand how they wouldn't be bored with this film. It's music every couple of mins and everything is way over the top. Actors were great but the script isn't entertaining at all. Honestly the trailer was more fun than the movie. My kids were bored and wanted to leave before the end. But after we made it through the first half of the movie, we might as well suck it up until the end. All in all, an amazing cast and set, but it falls short in actually entertaining the audience.16 out of 25 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",4,Barbie
"I must admit, growing up I've had complicated feelings toward Barbie. In the beginning she was fun (my favorite was one of the mermaid Barbies), but growing up I distanced myself from the pink toy. It was no surprise I wasn't excited about the movie until I heard Greta was involved.This movie is exactly what I would want from a Barbie movie. It's extremely campy throughout, but also recognizes that life is very much complicated. It's not easy being an adult woman or man. Do you want to laugh? Watch this movie. Do want to feel seen and have one of those cathartic cries? Then go and watch this movie!1 out of 7 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"I was not expecting this movie to be great; I'm not into this kind of stuff, but still, I watched it, and man, it was great; some scenes are relatable to how people react to something nowadays, like, come on, everything and everyone can be cancelled, the overall acting of the cast is super great. I love it; almost all the song are catchy and complements the movie (like this song, by the way (Im just Ken)); the production set for this film is majestic, and parts of the movie are touching and somewhat relatable to our everyday life, and there can be something to learn from, very recommended to watch this with your whole family and friends.0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"While not seeing previous Greta Gerwig's movies might have been a mistake on my side, starting exploring her filmography with Barbie (2023) was surely quite an interesting choice. Honestly, I was a little scared and worried about finally seeing this film - after so much hype on Twitter and other social media it would be disappointing finding out that the movie is not a 10 masterpiece. Eventually, I decided that no matter how bad (or good) Barbie actually is, at least I will have the pleasure of seeing Ryan Gosling's astonishing face (and body) on the big screen. The first few scenes of the film absolutely captivated me with their doll-like, plastic pink aesthetic, showing Barbieland as a perfect, colorful paradise. I have to admit though, once our two main characters travelled to the real world, things got a little cheesy. Of course I didn't expect Barbie to be deep or dramatic, but for me it fell into the family toys-come-to-life movie cliche a little bit too much. However, I really liked the comedious aspect of the film, all the references to history of the Barbie doll and others. I might as well say that Barbie became my new comfort movie, something to watch with your best buds, or even a loved one.8 out of 43 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I honestly cannot understand those rating on here. The first half ot the movie is exactly what I expected from a barbie movie; it's fun, it's pink and it was just a great watch but then (oh lord) the second half started. Although I understand that the producers try to address certain issues in society but this has absolutely no place in a Barbie movie. I don't really enjoy it when a highly extravaganted issues is being shoved into my face. I honestly cannot understand how the producers thought that's the way to do it. It leaves a bitter taste behind and destroys the good vibes from the beginning of the movie. I'm extremely disappointed.26 out of 40 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"With some of the greatest casting seen in a film (looking at you, Alan), this film was bound to be an enjoyable watch. Maggot Robbie plays her role with a sense of misplaced optimism, anxiety and true ennui. She questions her place in a world she no longer understands and brings us with her to find out. Ryan Gosling goes on his own journey of self discovery, understanding and empathy. Incredible costumes, sets, choreography and songs are a joy to behold on the screen. Great Gerwig expertly navigates complex topics with warmth and compassion, making us all wonder if the power of Barbie can truly help to heal the real world.0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"I Love this one so much!! Movie of the year!!! Most men here will criticize and give it a bad grade, but you have no idea how much a film like this can touch the heart of every mother, daughter and girl who loves Barbie dolls in the whole world, it is moving to watch all of this, besides that final scene only serves to show the struggle that women have always suffered their whole lives and that their daughters and those who will come in the future will suffer. A film that sends such an important message is extremely important to us. I laughed and cried so much, was such a lovely experience, i wish i could watch again but this time with my mom.4 out of 14 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"My girlfriend and I went to see this movie last night on the day of release because she was so excited for it. Going into it, I had my doubts... I was pleasantly surprised.The attention to detail was truly amazing, the colourful Barbie World, the way the dolls moved and interacted with objects, the references to less popular and discontinued Barbie dolls.I thought that the comedy in the movie was going to be completely cringe worthy. However, the movie was actually funny. There was not any point that I felt that they were trying too hard to make the movie funny or anything like that. There was just the right amount of humour for a movie like this.The adult humour was a bit of fun too, fair to say that I did get a good amount of laughs whilst watching.Allan (one of the discontinued Barbie Doll models) was my favourite character throughout the movie. Though his role was fairly small and he was there for a bit of comic relief, he was funny and also somewhat relatable.I appreciate that this movie is not for everyone, that being said, I do think that there will be many mixed reviews about this movie.I for one have nothing bad to say about the movie, my girl and I thoroughly enjoyed it, so much so that she walked out of that movie much happier than when we walked in.1 out of 9 found this helpful.

"This is the first movie I've ever watched that I cannot stop thinking about. The way that it perfectly describes how it is to grow up as a woman and lose your girlhood, while the weight of society comes down at you all at once is insane. Margot Robbie was quite literally the most perfect choice for this movie and I have never had such a sinking feeling in my chest while also loving a movie so so so much. The one problem is that it is so catered to women that the men watching literally just don't understand. The point of the movie, at least what I think is the point, is to show how women are still being put underneath men, but these men watching wont get the same reaction women do. They wont understand how true this movie is and how in a world full of Ken's, they should be an Allan.4 out of 14 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Anyone who gives this movie above a 1 star has a vested financial interest in its success. This was basically just a mess of a movie. All over the place plot with nonsense scenes and situations. There were some funny scenes but at its core, it just had no depth, logic or meaning other than Barbie v. Ken. Let's present a fake world where either men rule and women are puppets or women rule and men are puppets. This reads like someone's thesis on the state of feminism in modern society. I feel bad for the families that took their children to see this expecting something lighthearted and fun. This was not it. Just silly...10 out of 18 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"I did not know what to expect from the Barbie movie when I went with my two adult daughters. I was very pleasantly surprised! The movie made me laugh and it sometimes brought a tear to my eye (but I mostly laughed through it). The sets are spectacular. I would not be surprised if the movie wins an Academy Award for at least the set design. Ryan Gosling is very funny as the underrated Ken and Margot Robbie is very well suited to play the iconic doll. A very good commentary on how, sometimes, the Real World works. The story was, at times, very touching, but it's mostly a really good time. I loved it!!3 out of 9 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Barbie lives in a perfect world.When she discovers the real world, she realises that people age, have depression, family issues, and do not see the world as a perfect place that they want to be in everyday.This theme of Barbie coming to terms with what it means to be a human, with both the lows and the highs, is what leads to some truly beautiful scenes that make the room freeze. I saw the movie in a packed venue, a couple hundred people all munching crisps and children rustling and asking questions.During these scenes, everything was silent. No one moved, ate, or talked.As for the rest of the movie, it was great. If you're just looking for a good movie, this is one. Plenty of humour and the soundtrack is amazing, an instant save on Spotify. The dance sequences, especially the ones with Ken, are a feast for the eyes. The movie touches on the idea that you dont have to be perfect or the best. You dont have to be a lawyer/doctor, or a celebrity, or a nobel prize winner. There is nothing worng with just being average.The only thing stopping me from rating higher is a personal itch with the movie - the main part of the movie is Barbie dealing with a male dominated society (patriarchy) and all the issues women face in that. I don't mind the concept, but after the movie I wished that wasn't the main focus. It would have been a masterpiece 10 of a movie if it had focused on the problems of the human soul (sadness, loss, regret) and the joys of human life (raising a child, friends, finding happiness in the worst places) instead of ""boys vs girls"".Lastly, I would recommend a word of caution for any parents taking children to see it - it is rated a 12+ (at least in the UK) and thats solely due to the sexual undertones and jokes thrown around. Nothing terrible, but could be slightly uncomfortable.The hype surrounding the movie paid off, I'm glad I watched it.1 out of 11 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"It definitely lived up to my expectations. Walking into the theater I was scared. Considering all the amazing marketing and promotion for this movie, it could've been easily disappointing, but it wasn't for me. The acting was amazing, the jokes and dialogue were funny, but most importantly, it had a message and they stick to it throughout the movie. I don't think the world is ready for a film centered around women, maybe it's too soon. I think some men will wrongly assume that it is an ""anti-men"" movie and they will hate it for it. It's far from that. My hope is that, with time, people will understand its message and realize that we're all Kenough.0 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"For me this is the most pointless movie I've ever watched. I really don't understand where all this hype came from. My expectations were not that high considering the type of movie, but sill I waa not prepared for this -> which is the reason why I leave my first review in IMDB.For me this movie is just milking the Barbie brand. Great cast though! The sets, the costumes, the colours - these was perfect. And the actors play so well that you actually cringe while watching :)So, should you watch it?Haha no.

"When I'm going to see a movie I don't do research beforehand. I like to make up my own mind and hate spoilers. I didn't even have a look at the trailer in this case so I really didn't know what to expect from Barbie.But it's a gorgeous masterpiece, clever, surprisingly deep. People who say it's not just don't get it. For real.The full message is round up at the very end.I laughed, I cried, it truly hit me right in the feels.The set was out of this world. The costume designs were awesome.Performances by Margot, Ryan, America were fantastic. The rest was great too.Can't wait to see it again <3.1 out of 6 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Barbie is a movie about Barbie having an existential crisis! Yeah, that's actually the movie. And it's GREATAll the Barbies in barbieland, believe that they helped woman and young girls be whatever they want to be and empowered them, but Margot Robbie's Barbie finds out that's not true, she completely looses it.Margot Robbie is fantastic and both sides of the spectrum, the stereotypical Barbie and portraying the existential crisis she is one. But at this point what can't Margot Robbie do, she's fantasticRyan Gosling is the real MVP, he puts in a performance of a life time. The ""Ken off""... ""Ken War""?... ""War of Ken's""? Whatever! That whole sequence is amazing, from the song, to the choreography. Ryan Goslings comedic timing is impeccable, and I love the journey he embarks in, and his ending, to finding out he doesn't live for Barbie, he is his own ""Ken""The production design is absolutely fantastic, every single detail is looked after, the costumes are beautiful everything in Barbieland is so colourful and so pretty to look at.There comes a disconnect when they reach the real world, that is a necessary evil. I say that because I didn't like many of the sequences there, but I thought every was necessary for the rest of the movie to work.Not every joke lands, but that's what happens when you take risks, the movie is hilarious nonetheless.It's a fantastic time and my only regret is that I didn't find a pink shirt to wear to the movie.2 out of 20 found this helpful.

"As a huge Barbie fan I was first sceptic, but as the movie trailers came out I got more and more enthousiastic. The movie was a big 10 for me. The jokes, the costumes, the actors, the atmosfere, it is all there!!!! Even the music is so nice with all the extras!This movie definitely deserves Oscar's,If you are a big Barbie fan you will understand the jokes even better! Especially if you are older than 30. It's fantastic! It is not really a movie for childrens, they will love the dancing and clothes and so but will not understand everything I think.So if you want to have a good laugh! Go see this movie!17 out of 82 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"This film is filled with cheap cinematic and comedic tricks dying for attention and relevance. In the end, the moments are stale and require as sense of ""I guess I should laugh or chuckle a little, poor things.""The film preys solely upon the desperate desire permeating American culture for something, anything, please. (Nope still don't have anything original or high-quality in this Era of film-making).Most sequences of the film are a collection of ""unbelievable!"" instagram-like moments strung together with a lazy unity that affirms one thing: confusion.This film grossly underestimates the IQ of its audience or lacks the subtly and nuance to pursue the complex arguments regarding its central socio-political themes. It says only so much, afraid at every step to be cancelled but also trying to stand firm in some desperation for truth, to help stand up to that mean Mattel! The same Mattel that Warner Bros (who produced the Barbie film) is partnered with.Margot Robbie tries to give it her all (she can open one eye tear stream with the best of them) but her performance lacks the quiet composure of all struggling with identity issues. It is surely a barbie-rific film! Although even the fake smiles of the actors seem fake, almost as if they are saying, ""I can't believe I am doing this."" They almost solemnly predict the end of the film before a single ounce of real joy can be seen/had. The entire film is depressing, even where it is supposed to be joyful.There is no great sense of play. It appears everyone is outstandingly self-conscious and hyper aware. Weirdly hyper aware. These aren't artists (with perhaps the exception of Gosling). These are everyday men and women pretending to be actors and absurdly conscious of it. One can only get along with color palettes, explosions, and circus jokes / ""provocative"" one liners for so long. The real attempt at story was shaky at best. Amazingly studios allow Gerwig to direct a high school film project with a 150 million dollar budget and a volunteer casting call of beginning drama students and a few pretty people who always wanted to be in a movie.The long wait gets longer. When will art take a step forward? We have an American culture of business people (all greedy for more money, money, money)-very well, we lack artists!26 out of 43 found this helpful.

"At the beginning, it cleverly reflects social issues through gender reversal, but not merely as a reversal. Both gender groups retain their essence, and the ending isn't about one group's victory over the other, but about working together. It encompasses not only gender equality but also recognition and acceptance of others and oneself. It's not about feminism, patriarchy, or gender confrontation. It's not about stereotypes or perfectionism. It's about gender equality, embracing individuality, and mutual understanding. This movie isn't exclusively for women; it showcases the fierce presentation of chuunibyou (middle school syndrome) in both genders. Outstanding performances and dance sequences keep the entire film engaging without clichés.0 out of 7 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"The duality of being perfect and yet still not being enough is portrayed so well here. This movie is about being able to relate to the constant evolution of the human condition, specifically in a way that centers growing up from being a naive child to being aware of yourself and the judgement of others. This movie does center women, but any individual claiming this movie is a misandrist anthem has no idea of even a notion to what the point of this movie was.Hilarious, intelligent, beautiful, poignant, tasteful. This movie makes me warm to the knowledge of being a woman. I will be watching more Greta movies from now on if not all of them. I cried.3 out of 11 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Barbie was by far one of the best movies i've watched in 2023. From the acting to the costumes, it was all just so amazing. I have no words to express how i feel after watching Barbie. It had to much emotion built into it. Margot Robbie had such a speechless performance. Greta Grewig is the writer and director that can make a movie that has so much emotional value and meaning. It gives you a look into being a woman and the struggles but also about finding who you are as a person. I enjoyed this movie like no other it was hilarious and an emotional rollercoaster. I hope we can see a sequel to Barbie. The movie deserves all the love. Go watch it now!!!3 out of 11 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"I wanted a girly movie with humor, amazing looks, and a feminist plot. A true show for the ladies. And this gave me that and more. So many profound moments, so many funny lines, such good acting, the cinematography was beautiful, the sets were perfect, the outfits were on point. First girls movie I love with no overt emphasis on a romantic relationship. Just a beautiful, complex, funny story about barbie. Everyone was perfectly casted. I was nervous about all the young children in the audience but there was no sexual scenes, little cursing, and most innuendo seemed to go over their heads.

"I was amongst the people who thought they saw a majority of this film based on all of the filming stills posted on the bird app in 2022. I still wanted to see it. Something about their perfect neon rollerblading outfits. I saw one preview and wasn't sure what the plot was going to be, I didn't care, I still wanted to see it. I wasn't expecting it to be amazing, but amazing it was. Well done!! Margot really knocked it out of the dollhouse. Ryan I'll never look at the same way way again. This 1980s Barbie Superman is very pleased. It won't be long until the opening dance scene is all over the clock app. I haven't felt so compelled to learn choreography since Michael Jackson's Thriller. Also, girls rule.

If someone hates on this movie is because they did not understand the message and meaning behind it. Margot Robbie did an excellent job portraying Barbie. Would totally rewatch this movie. This movie made me laugh, cry, and made me think about my childhood. Its such a beautiful movie. Greta Gerwig is one of the best directors of this generation. Truly the best movie released this year.

"Unfortunately this story is so bad the acting and sets can't save it .It is pretty to look at like a Barbie , but lacks a story that is worth the effort .I think small girls will like it but other than that it's a stupid movie idea that comes across as an advertisement for a toy company .Not sure you will want to spend your money on this wait for it to stream .Kids fell asleep after the first 30 minutes .Not sure who the audience is .The story is so bad it's like it was hobbled together by a bunch of tweens brainstorming .I think this could be the worst movie of the decade .There are much better kids movies out there.7 out of 13 found this helpful.

"This movie is not only an actually funny comedy with an amazing script and good jokes, but a seriously intense story of womanhood, girlhood and motherhood that portrayed how much the patriarchy affects everyone. As a girl, this movie resonated with me and every single line about being a girl in this world hit me hard, but it was so beautiful. I've seen men say that this movie was 'feminist garbage' or 'over-exaggerated' but it honest to god wasn't. Not only this, but while being a movie that accurately represents the feeling of not knowing who you are or what you are going to be (aka girlhood) it was pro-men and not in a bad way. Somehow, a movie so strongly empowering women also gave men feeling and hurt. This made the movie so honest and just good. I could go on for hours about how much this movie means to me, and that it's something with messages that will stick with me forever.With all this being said, it was funny as hell and my whole theater was dying at some of the jokes made 😭 they did not hold back.3 out of 12 found this helpful.

About reality. None of the nonsense of ask the Barbie Movies. In all honesty it was about patriarchy and feelings being human. It was also about the relationship between children as they grow up and their toys. It would not be something i would expect to bring someone under the age of 13 to and expect them to be entertained. Very much more silly adult stuff than kids in the sense of being to understand.I told my human it was pretty much Rocky Horror Picture Show without the sexuality and way more pink. Not really a movie to take serious but lighthearted and just a goofy movie to enjoy on some down time. If it wasn't so new then i would do an Episode on my podcast about it.0 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink,8,Barbie
"This Barbie script, IMHO, is packed on so many levels of thought - on were we are today and how we got there. To those who trash it, I say, ""Lighten up Francis.""Everyone plays their part uniquely and with verve. And the set alone should be considered for an Oscar. We needed this movie for the sake of sanity... too much politicking has clouded the atmosphere.To all those who grew up with Barbie, Ken, and G. I. Joe, I hope you remember that it was a time for childlike innocence to play and have fun.There is truth in comedy... just ask Aristophanes.Reflect on it.Note: The reference to Kubrick's 2001 (1968) is absolutely hysterical.0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"As a teenager I kinda just went to this movie because of all the hype and jokes on Instagram, TikTok etc. But surprisingly this movie was actually really good. Unsurprisingly Margot Robbie was phenomenal, and was the PERFECT choice for Barbie.When the movie first started I really didn't know what it was going to be, I thought it would just be a girly movie about dolls and feminists, and everything wrong with Hollywood nowadays, but this quickly proved otherwise. It had the perfect amount of jokes, (which were surprisingly funny) the plot was simple but entertaining . Toward the end of the movie it got really serious, and it really had me thinking about life in a way where I just want to get my life together and be a better person. In conclusion this movie was great and Greta Gerwig did an amazing job with the cast and the movie as a whole!!!3 out of 24 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"For a girl who grew up playing with Barbies wasn't at all what I thought it would be. I didn't think there would be a huge plot, and I was so wrong! The movie should be what every woman needs to see. Everyone in it was amazing and perfect (not Barbie perfect 😉). Had an amazing plot that made me really consider how far women have not come in life. I do love the line when a man has to ask for a job in the government and gets told he can have a much lesser job. I can not give it enough accolades. Everyone cast was perfect for their role.

In 2023, We live in a complex society with extreme sexism which has been brilliantly addressed by none other than Barbie! The last Product that one would expect to address this issue. Was it perfect, no- nothing is perfect today. It didn't cover many topics. But did it do an excellent job at covering the topic they decided to address - absolutely YES! They can take my money - again and again for creating content that is relevant and important and changes all our perspectives. The cast was brilliant. I can't believe how many people they roped in. And Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were AMAZING as Barbie and Ken.0 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Barbie is a hot pink mess, that ironically sees world in two dimensional black and white. Aside from Margot and Ryan, all the characters are literal one dimensional bimbo.Yes, i'm aware of the over the top humour, and almost cartoonish art direction is intentional. Yes, there's supposedly more 'substance' , than the style's portrayed. But the message is so generic, and only on surface level that nothing that hasn't been done before.TO BE FAIR, some part of it is actually enjoyable, and i had a few laugh. Margot and Ryan are great, but the rest of the casts is awkard. And the ending is kinda nice. Overall it's ended up being a 'meh' for me.5 Puking rainbow.3 out of 4 found this helpful.

"This movie made me so proud to be a woman and really appreciate the human experience! It's amazing that a film centered around a toy managed to shed light on the genuine highs and lows of being human, making it a refreshing watch! It was funny, visually stunning, emotionally resonant and engaging. I'm not sure why some have labeled it as ""preachy"" or ""agenda-driven,"" because it merely highlighted the realities faced by women today. If these aspects were challenging to watch, that might have been the film's intent - to resonate with its target audience. I appreciate that the movie reminds us what Barbie's original purpose was, to empower girls around the world! So to everyone who feels that this movie was a personal attack, it might be best for you to stop over analyzing every little thing because you weren't the target audience anyway. Highly recommend!!0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"I haven't written a review on IMDb before but I felt like I need to for this film.Genuinely one of the most heartwarming yet emotionally poignant movies I've seen for a very long time, and honestly the first movie I've genuinely felt understood by.It made me laugh it made me cry, I never expected the Barbie movie of all things to stick like it did and strike a chord with me. This is a movie that links directly into my experiences as a woman and perfectly encapsulates what it feels like to be under the societal pressures of being a woman and the impossibilities we face every day. America Ferrera's monologue was incredible.Honestly, I'd recommend this film to anyone and feel like it's crucial that it gets the recognition it deserves. Greta Gerwig is a phenomenal director and I can't wait for her next project.0 out of 0 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8,Barbie
"I expected this to be a very good movie with some feminist undertones. It ended up being insanely funny, ridiculous, fun, and stupidly entertaining, yet highly topical and commentative. This movie hit on so many topics, patriarchy, capitalism, feminism, even misandry, yet managed to stay consistently funny and wild throughout. It never goes where you expect it to go but always defies expectations. The only reason I don't give this a 10 is for the small section of time where the feminism appears a bit too heavy-handed, and I can see where that would cause some male viewers to lose interest in the message. Other than that, this is the best movie I've seen in years and I can't see any topping it any time soon.2 out of 8 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9,Barbie
"I went to see the movie with the feeling it was being hyped to much and with not so high expectations, -even though I admire Greta Gerwig a lot- but not even fifteen minutes into the movie I was already laughing and crying and hooked. It is definitely one of the funniest I've seen in at least 2 years, it has a simple storyline that works exactly as it suppose to without trying to be something else. The message is powerful and easy to understand, I found it refreshing and truthful, sometimes it may feel even a bit naive, but in the end it is what it is and I appreciated that. The performances are really delightful and full of small nuances that make them easy to connect with, even though the tone is satiric and farcical. Great movie, a lot more than I expected.1 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8,Barbie
"I wanted to like this movie but it was just plain silly. Maybe it's meant for pre-teens. I can't believe Margo and Ryan needed the money so bad they accepted these roles. Ive also noticed that Goslin puts way too much make up on and a lot of the shots are animated or touched up digitally to make him look younger. He is 43 yrars old. Thiwcis not the type of role for him. Hollywood really needs to step up when it comes to quality. Barbie movie??? I mean, that's just unnecessary. I can't believe some people here thought it was entertaining. Don't waste your hard earned money on this one. Avoid at all costs.7 out of 11 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"A good movie with an important message that is delivered in a way that makes it easy to understand and can resonate with alot of people. Hopefully the way they delivered the message leads people to see the issues they depict in the movie.I truly recomend this movie to everyone who likes ""kids"" movies that also has a good message. The way that the Barbie world was created leads the viewer to be sucked into the world of Barbie. Also the references and homages to other movies and also Barbie sets and movies really sets the cake.A bonus point is that all of Kens lines in the movie is comedy gold and made the whole theater giggle a few times.0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"""Barbie,"" the film, is an enchanting cinematic experience that is sure to entertain viewers of all ages. It's a vibrant and delightful exploration into the world of one of the most enduring and iconic dolls ever created. Its storyline is compelling and keeps you engaged throughout, making it a truly wonderful movie.What makes the movie stand out is its successful use of humor and adventure that ensures it isn't just another kids movie, but a family affair where adults can also derive enjoyment. Furthermore, the movie is brimming with fun characters that each add a unique flair to the narrative.A major highlight of the film is the character of Ken. He isn't merely a supporting role, but emerges as a real scene-stealer. Ken's charisma and witty dialogue delivery is splendid, adding a new layer to his character that audiences are sure to appreciate. His performance has a certain charm that makes you look forward to his scenes. Indeed, he truly stole the show.Despite the largely engaging narrative, the movie does come with a few plot holes. At times, the story lacks logic, and there are certain developments that seem a bit rushed or inadequately explained. However, considering that the movie is based on the universe of Barbie, where the rules of reality are often bent, these plot holes can be somewhat expected and forgivable.In conclusion, ""Barbie"" is an entertaining and heartwarming film that successfully captures the essence of its source material. Its flaws are minor and largely overshadowed by its vibrant characters, engaging narrative, and a particularly standout performance by Ken. Even with some plot holes, it's a cinematic treat that offers plenty of enjoyment for both kids and adults.5 out of 26 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
Gets you a typical Hollywood movie which feels good to watch but provokes you to think it helps you decide whether you want to be just influenced by the world around you the media the news and the industry which is grabbing your attention or do you want to accept that you are a human being with needs and wants and not just a piece of toy to be manipulated by the media.It begins with a simile of everybody's life that is Barbie land it is kind of our own sweet world which every human being prefers to live into rather than entering into the race of humans into the workforce and do the society etc and their Barbie and can reflect upon how different the real world can be from the world they're used to kind of like what happens to people of every kind I think this is a super movie too provoking people to think are they living to please the world around them or are they just living to live.1 out of 6 found this helpful.

"Barbie is the problem with modern Hollywood. I'm not a sexist, but this movie shows how all men are trash. The ending drags so long, just tell ""the message"". There are some gags that landed and the whole theater, packed with girls, laughed, but there were some, where the theatre was quite and i could hear only the fart of the woman sitting next to me. If the main villian Will Farrel, wasn't there, the movie is gonna be a little better, because the villians do nothing and only drag the pace of the movie. Greta Gerwig for the most part, did a pretty good job and the casting is perfect. Ryan Gosling is born for this role and Margot Robbie is great, as i expected. Overall, the movie is not for me. The little girls will deffinely like a lot more, than i did.9 out of 14 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",4,Barbie
"(let me apologize for my english beforehand) Oh my gosh... I don't even know where to start. I was very exited to watch this movie, and I decided to go see it for the first time with my best friend with whom I used to play barbies. However, I did not expected the movie to be so emotional: I cried in four different moments. In particular, the scene with the eldery woman on the bench makes me cry everytime I think about it! This movie touches a lot of parts about womanhood that we rearly get to see on the big screen, it critizes and in someways explains the patriarchy in a vey obvious way, whitch makes me think that the (mostly) men who are complaining about it have probably seen the movie with their eyes closed.Please, girls, go watch it with a woman you love, that makes you feel safe and let you be you, because this is an experience that needs to be shared with other women.It's one of the saddest movie I've ever seen, but somehow it filled me with hope. Now I'll go back crying about this movie while listening to ""what was i made for"" lol.2 out of 20 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Yes it was a bit preachy at times (the feminist speech that the mom/America Ferrera gave in the middle of the movie was out of place) but overall the message was ok and the movie was cute. I had some doubts about casting but Ryan Gosling killed it and Margot Robbie is obviously the closest to a real life Barbie you could get in the modern day.I'm not really sure the target age demographic either. I'm 17 and saw it with my mom and we both liked it, but idk it might not be great for super little kids. It's not overly vulgar or anything but at times it seems more focused on appealing to teenage girls and grown women.Also, Michael Cera is rad and probably the best part of the movie for me. His role is super fitting and it's fun to see him dressed all in pastel and pink, being a relatively normal dude in scenes full of Barbies.0 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"This movie was everything that was expected of it. It was funny, feministic, cute, beautiful and everything plastic. It was probably expected by many that the movie would be very superficial and focus more on the fun side of barbie, but it surprised us. This movie took a deep dive into what it is to be a girl and a woman in today's society and in the patriarchal world we live in today. It also brought into daylight the problematic history surrounding the plastic doll with many humorous elements. The only thing that brought this film down from a 10 was that it was everything we expected, and was missing a surprising plot twist. All in all I really recommend to watch this movie, it was a wonderful experience in the cinema!1 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9,Barbie
"This thought-provoking movie is definitely not geared towards children or exclusively for girls; it's a must-watch for audiences of all backgrounds. It addresses delicate and fragile topics with precision. It was surprising and totally unexpected. Admittedly, the first half an hour is hard to get through, but you really get into it once you get the idea and you're totally consumed in it and already questioning yourself and the society before you realise. However, they could have concluded it better by finding a middle ground or presenting a solution to the problems addressed. Nevertheless, its overall impact makes it a must-see for everyone.3 out of 18 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8,Barbie
"Barbie is a really refreshing movie! Directed with a truly unique style that brings the Barbie universe to life, it tackles deep topics (gender issues, consumerism...) with a lot of humor. It opens a lot of interesting conversations in a very new way, switching perspectives to let the viewer experience the irony of the world we live in today.The only downside is that you have to close those doors, and that leads to a more cliche/expected wrap up of the story that takes away some of the uniqueness brought by the movie.Overall, a very recommended watch and a guilty pleasure for years to come!2 out of 9 found this helpful.

"A confused, misfiring, tedious and pretentious affair. I was expecting much better, yet ultimately disappointed. Margot Robbie (and to a lesser extent, Ryan Gosling) is very good, but otherwise even she can't save this twaddle. Don't listen to the critics - it is crap!Pros: the opening scene apeing '2001 a Space Odyssey' was funny.Cons: It needed better editing to create a more coherent structure It had very dull patches (despite the pink) The emphasis on the 'patriarchy' was definitely laid on too thick Will Ferrell was not funny in this. He needs to really understand that whatever comes out of his mouth is not necessarily instant comedy gold.Avoid!!!!!23 out of 31 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"This movie is an easy 10 for me, did not disappoint. The casting, the directing, the plot, the cinematography, the sets, the detail, the acting, the jokes, it was all perfect. I want to rewatch this movie already! I watched it with my family and it is definitely enjoyable for everyone, the kids might not understand the movie as much but my sibling still really enjoyed it. This movie made me laugh and cry, it focuses on womanhood and mother daughter relationships in both a light hearted and sad way. I have absolutely no complaints about this movie whatsoever, absolutely loved it and recommend.0 out of 4 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Barbie was an extremely fun movie that was entertaining and funny throughout the entire runtime of the movie. The jokes were witty, funny, well-written and did not impede on the tone of any serious moments. Barbie was for sure targeted for kids but made for adults to enjoy just as much as the little ones. The casting was phenomenal, every actor embodied their character, Margot Robbie is dynamite in her role delivering every line with sincerity and real feeling. Ryan Gosling was the epitome of Ken, fun, and lovable but he was also able to sublimely deliver emotions that one would not associate with Ken. With 2 powerful stars you would think that the secondary characters would be unnoteworthy, but Simu Liu, and Will Ferrell command the screen so remarkably, not to mention every other Barbie and Ken, and Allen too. All of this without even mention the cinematography and the breathtaking music which culminates into a delightful story that impressively tackles pretty serious issues.0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"So many positive messages for women and men alike! Barbie has an existential crisis and Ken embraces the worst of the patriarchy. Both just seeking deeper meaning - what were they made for? Meaningful subtext while being wildly entertaining!All the acting was just delightful! Ryan Gosling even steals the show - though every performance was spot on. Thanks to Greta Gerwig and Mattel for an innovative, thought provoking, gloriously vibrant extravagant movie watching experience. It is destined to be a classic.Even better, it has stirred up controversy that hopefully can lead to discourse on the themes embedded in something with such great entertainment value.0 out of 8 found this helpful.

"With a production by Mattel it self it's an amazing marketing idea to invite, the critical young thinkers of this generation, to the brand. With lots of self criticism, the movie give other vision about the atual demand of what the Barbie doll always should be.The movie jokes with the patriarch world we live and also shows a subtil criticism over it with the ""other side"". Almost like - Equilibrium should win this battle.Jokes about the masculinity and the critics themselves, showing a child who critic the old Barbie fans at the same time as she itself is a ""Barbie"" of the new era.At the same time brings us, the main public (early 90s under) all the nostalgic memories of playing dolls. That should be soft but people are always trying to be something else.Great deal.0 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"I went to this movie without watching previews or expecting anything. This movie turned out to be everything a Barbie-loving thirty-something needed twenty years ago. Expertly cast, the Barbie movie is hilariously self-aware and has no dull moments. Though the Micheal is obviously mainly about Barbie, Ken has his own moment to shine that ends up being the subplot.The movie was beautiful visually and funny from beginning to end. The attention to detail was clear and the storyline had the theater crying happy tears by the end. Definitely see it if you are a parent and take your parent friends with you. Make sure you wear pink ;)We would see it again and again!0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Barbie is supposed to be happy, peppy, but here she and her world is the complete opposite. She might smile, and there might be bright colours, but underneath this is dark, very dark. This is also strangely adult with plenty of adult humour. Barbie is usually also about empowerment and be who you are sort of a thing, but that is not what this is about. Not at all. This movie is made out of pure seething hate, hatred of all that is good, proper and real.This might be the darkest, most evil movie I have seen.We watched this just after Oppenheimer, because we wanted to make a full day out of it and watch both movies. And we all know that Oppenheimer is not the happiest movie, with a pretty heavy subject matter, but this Barbie movie is far, far worse. Imagine that? A couple of nuclear bombs killing hundreds of thousands and Barbie is still worse...The positives is that there was a couple of jokes that landed, but only felt weird laughing at anything in this movie. And there were a couple of cute moments, but those only felt forced in there and felt false, like a shadow of what is really going on. The movie is also fairly competently made so I cannot really fault cinematography too much, although there is plenty to complain about there too.I would strongly suggest that you never, ever, take your kids to see this movie. Hide it from them. And to anyone who wants to see this, I suggest you put on a tinfoil hat and drink a lot.2 because there are some competence behind making the movie b.11 out of 24 found this helpful.

Very good felt like it dragged a but at the end for me which brings the marks down. But overall a very good film with good and enjoyable characters and plot line. Good aspects of comedy in some moments with a good soundtrack to partner with the film. I enjoyed the scenes in barbie land the most but that's not to say the scenes in the real world weren't enjoyable. It wasn't what I expected it to be in a good way. It clearly didn't have a mainly child audience which made it a lot more enjoyable. I loved watching how barbie and Ken adapted to the real world compared to barbie land and how mainly reacted to things that she can't do in barbie land like drinking.0 out of 5 found this helpful.

"I am not kidding, the movie was hilarious, self aware, touching, camp, beautiful, it was everything. My friend told me it was rare to hear me laugh so much, next to us was a couple and the bf was also dying from laughter. The ""this movie is not for me"" means that you maybe are close minded, if you go to see anything with prejudice, you will more likely not enjoy it. I think it is fair if it isn't your cup of tea but don't review bomb the movie, there nany famous movies that are not for me but i don't think they are bad. Why can't women, mothers and daughters have something for them? All those 1 star reviews are disgusting.

"I definitely went in with doubts, as one does with the mass market films of day; but this was overwhelmingly more than good. It was the first actually great big box film I've seen in some time.I should've known. Greta Gerwig, with her smart indie-film whit, created something for everyone. Easy jokes. Clever jokes not everyone will latch onto. Even physical humor to get the kids cackling.All with a great message about finding the value in one's uniqueness at its core. Loved the self-poking Mattel allowed with that tax jokes.I will forever be saying ""Get in the box Jezebel."" Heck, it may even replace ""Get in losers. We're going shopping.""Mark of a real success.1 out of 5 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",9,Barbie

Would highly recommend and would totally go back and see again and buy once out. Loved how everyone also gets in barbie theme and go dressed in pink.3 out of 17 found this helpful.

Everything was that I expected. Pink world and lots of beautiful Barbie's and handsome Ken's gathered together. And it's interesting that just as we played with our dolls, the Barbies in the movie were also taken into play! Then one of my childhood dreams that was Barbie in the real world came true and it was interesting to me... How wonderful it is that Margot Robbie was chosen to perform this role..

"I thought the first half of the movie was hilarious and well done, but the last act of the movie is where it lost me. Instead of trying to communicate a message, it really felt like it was preaching way too much. Instead of showing, it tells you what to think in the last act of the movie.The only thing it has going for it is the set desing, wardrobe and music.Aside from tha the movie is plastic like the eponymous doll.The characters have no plot development, literal cliches.If you write characteres as abstractions , at least try to make into characters that are relatable to the viewer.Do not waste your time with this movie.93 out of 223 found this helpful.

"This movie captures the frustrating yet wonderful feeling of being a woman in this world more than any other film I feel so seen and acknowledged. I ended up crying as the credits rolled just because I felt like all the emotions I couldn't put into words and no one could ever understand were said in this film. This is a movie for everyone, not just women, it makes us reflect about power roles and how we should all work together towards a more equal world for all.Unlike what some people might believe it is not ""anti men"" the whole point of Ken's story line is how he learns toxic masculinity is dangerous, not only for women but for men as well and just end up causing harm. In the end he learns he is more than just a partner and must find meaning in his life being his own person. I don't understand in what world that message is ""anti men"".1 out of 6 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",1,Barbie
"Okay I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's funny, it's charming, and also manages to make you cry. It reminds me of the kind of movie that becomes a cult classic years later, like Napoleon Dynamite or Drop Dead Gorgeous. It's definitely not for everyone, but in my opinion the wacky bounce between spoof and serious makes it wildly entertaining. This isn't a movie to take seriously, but it is definitely thought provoking. It's take on feminism and the patriarchy is displayed in a way that is almost making fun of itself. And I think that's nice, because the movie displays a message that everyone should be equal, living a life in a patriarchal society isn't great, but neither is one designed for women. Like The Importance of Being Earnest, it nods to the problems of the world in a comedic way, making it easier to digest.My only annoyance about this film is a bit of a spoiler, so read no more if you don't want to be spoiled (I definitely recommend watching this movie btw)Ken was bashed in this movie. He was treated like garbage, and it makes me sad. The poor guy didn't know how to be happy without Barbie liking him. The guy needs a hug and a better girlfriend. Cause Barbie was kind of a jerk to him in this movie. It irked me because no one would like that aspect if the roles were reversed. Anyway, watch this movie if you want to be entertained by a wacky plot and great underlying message.0 out of 2 found this helpful. Was this review helpful? Sign in to vote.Permalink",8,Barbie
"The only good things about this movie were the actors. Felt like I was watching one big commercial for Barbie constantly plugging outfits and what Barbie really means for young girls, I guess it was produced by Mattel which says a lot.I was hoping for something smart and satirical like the Lego Movie but this was just a silly story with dumb humour.The nostalgia is the draw card for people (including me) I loved Barbie growing up but it wasn't enough for me to enjoy this.Dont waste your time, the producers spent more on the advertising and promo work than they did getting a good story together.136 out of 316 found this helpful.

"I'm not a Barbie fan girl in the least, but I think this has become one of those movies I will cherish. Those who were offended that they stereotyped men and made so many of them ""weak"" or ""stupid"" in this movie are seriously missing the point. They stereotyped it all (women included) in a way that was very intentional and drove home some incredibly difficult aspects of the modern human condition. They took impossibly stressful expectations that society pushes on both sexes and made them light hearted and surprisingly emotional. As a woman, even though the situations with men in the movie were exaggerated and oversimplified, they were all incredibly reflective of so many of the experiences that I and countless other women have lived through. It was nice to be seen (and to be able to laugh and cry at how on point they were)... I very rarely feel that from a movie, much less from a movie about dolls that I hardly ever chose to play with as a kid. I think the only thing I was hoping for more of was a greater acknowledgment of some less binary identities. In my opinion there were so many opportunities to more than subtlety hint at diversity there. Either way I'm pleasantly surprised at the entertaining way they tackled serious issues, how they incorporated pop culture, and how they both gave homage to the history and aesthetic of Barbie without hiding from some of the dark aspects of Mattel's past.1 out of 6 found this helpful.

"I absolutely adored this movie, without spoilers I can say it's truly fun and surprisingly a lot deeper than you would initially think going into it. Beyond that I thought the cinematography was fantastic and the color palette was perfect, and above all else the acting was amazing from everyone in it! Especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, I know people were hesitant to accept him as Ken but he really knocks it out of the park, and I honestly cannot believe they considered people other than Margot Robbie to be Barbie. It's like she was BORN for this role. Absolutely adored this movie and I hope no one listens to the review bombing, it really is a treat!!0 out of 3 found this helpful. Was this review helpful?

"Greetings again from the darkness. As pupils slouched in our school desks during history class, we easily and naturally disassociated with the many stories of war. World War II was lumped in with WWI, the Civil War, and The Revolutionary War. There were names and dates to memorize for quizzes and final exams, yet even with relatives recounting stories of kin, a personal connection was rare. As we aged and experienced modern-day warfare, the personal connection became all too real. Reality struck that soldiers are human beings with families, and despite their missions and marching orders, most are as innocent as the 'tragic civilian casualties' reported on the newswires. Along these lines, an aspect of war that has often remained overlooked is the behind-closed-doors decision-making of politicians and military leaders. Filmmaker-extraordinaire Christopher Nolan takes us behind those doors through the eyes of J Robert Oppenheimer, the Father of the Atomic Bomb. What we see is quite frightening.Prepare yourself. At a full three hours in length, Nolan's film is a hefty undertaking for viewers. It demands full focus and attention to details and nuance, as you spend significant time listening to brilliant men talk amongst themselves. Nolan adapted the screenplay from the 2005 biography, ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer"", written by Kai Bird and Martin Sherman. The end result is a film centered on complex physics and mathematics, yet presented in a simplified manner such that it's much more a character study than a science class. The key is what characters say to each other, how they say it, and how they debate and rationalize the morality of the objective ... building a bomb designed to kill people.The morality of The Manhattan Project is under the microscope here, as is the motivation and concern of Oppenheimer. We get some early background establishing him as an upcoming mind in the world of physics from his academic stops around the globe. Some know Cillian Murphy from ""Peaky Blinders"" or as Scarecrow in Nolan's Batman movies. I'd also recommend a couple of Murphy's underrated gems: FREE FIRE (2016) and RED EYE (2005). It's hard to overstate how spot on Murphy is as Oppenheimer. He lost weight for the role and captures the distinctive movements and speech patterns, as well as the familiar poses and deep-in-thought eyes. We never once question whether this is Oppenheimer, the leader of the science team at the Los Alamos Lab and the Father of the Atomic bomb ... the one who ""sees beyond the world we live in.""
Once Major Groves (Oscar winner Matt Damon) recruits Oppenheimer to run and assemble the great scientific minds, the obvious question to those involved is ... even if we can create this bomb, should we do it? This weighs heavily on Oppenheimer - a man so engulfed by science that his haunting visions are that of atoms and particles and experimental reactions (perhaps a bit too heavy in the first act). Groves is the military leader of the project and the liaison between the scientists, the military, and the government. It's also clear that while Oppenheimer's brilliance is recognized and necessary to the project, almost no one outside of the scientists trusts him. This is where antisemitism and fears of communism arise. Oppenheimer was Jewish and, though he never joined the communist party, was associated with many who did. This included his love interest, Psychiatrist Jean Tatlock (the fabulous rising star Florence Pugh), his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), and his brother Frank (Dylan Arnold).The teamwork and stress involved with building the bomb in Los Alamos is conveyed as rooms full of brilliant minds determine the future path of the country and the world. This culminates in the stunning sequence of The Trinity Test near Alamogordo. A blending of complete silence, along with spectacular sound and light, is truly a technical highlight of the film. The initial celebration of success initially overshadows the true meaning ... the bomb is now ready for Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing two hundred thousand people and essentially ending WWII, less than four years after the bombing of Pearl Harbor by the Japanese (never mentioned here).The bombings are heard via radio news reports, and it's at this point where the weight of what the scientists have done is fully realized. Oppenheimer became a national hero and his Time Magazine cover proves it. A meeting with President Harry S Truman (Oscar winner Gary Oldman sporting a Missouri accent) doesn't go well, as Oppenheimer is introduced to political gamesmanship, something he would face even more directly in the near future. Lewis Strauss (Oscar winner Robert Downey Jr) is a key player as chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission, and through him, we witness ego, ambition, and petty behavior that leads to a level of vindictiveness typically only seen at the junior high level.Multiple timelines are covered. There is the background information on Oppenheimer's early years, his well-rounded academia, his love life (lives), his building of the Los Alamos lab team, the overseeing of the bomb development, his time as a hero, the later backroom kangaroo court designed to disgrace him, and Strauss' Senate Confirmation hearing for Secretary of Commerce. All of these tie together, and it's those final two that make up the last act of the film - giving us a taste of just how nasty politics was 70 years ago (not unlike these days).Nolan has assembled a deep cast with numerous Oscar winners and a roster of talented actors. Among the familiar faces not already named above are: Oscar winner Kenneth Branagh as Danish Physicist Neils Bohr, Oscar winner Rami Malek as experimental physicist David Hill, Oscar winner Casey Affleck as Military security advisor Boris Pash, Tom Conti as Albert Einstein, Benny Safdie, Dane DeHaan, Jason Clarke, Josh Hartnett, David Krumholtz, Matthew Modine, Alden Ehrenreich, Scott Grimes, Tony Goldwyn, James D'Arcy, James Urbaniak, Olivia Thirlby, James Remar, and (Nolan regular) David Dastmalchian.The film is a historical biopic and also an unconventional thriller. Is this about unparalleled advancement in science or is it about the moral dilemma of mass destruction and death? Politics, military, ego, power, science, love, revenge, and redemption are all displayed as Oppenheimer struggles with the power he has created and the lack of power in how it's used. My favorite line in the film is aimed at Oppenheimer when someone informs him that he's now ""not just self-important, but actually important."" The stakes are clear during the test when it's stated that there is a ""near zero"" chance of destroying the world.Cillian Murphy is a shoe-in for a Best Actor nomination, and his performance mesmerizes us. It's nice to see Robert Downey Jr remind us of his true talent, and he should be rewarded with a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt, in the only two substantive women roles, should both receive consideration as well. Pugh's role is limited but memorable, while Blunt shines in her best scene during the security hearing.Christopher Nolan has delivered near perfection in technical movie-making, and on top of that, the story and characters are real life, and the performances are top notch. His use of Black & White film for Strauss' perspective allows the viewer to differentiate the Oppenheimer viewpoint. Impressively, while there are some visual effects, Nolan has stated that no CGI was used in the film, and that's most evident in the relatively short closing credit roll - where we typically get dozens if not hundreds of technical experts listed. Ludwig Goransson's (Oscar winner for BLACK PANTHER) score packs an emotional punch, and Jennifer Lame's editing is excellent and vital. Lastly, cinematographer (and regular Nolan collaborator) Hoyte Van Hoytema drives home the power of smart men in a room, as well as the devastation of the bomb test. This is excellent filmmaking and a reminder that the only thing we love more than lifting new heroes onto the pedestal of worship is tearing down those same heroes with a dose of humility. These types of movies rarely get produced these days, so here's hoping enough people go back to the theater to see it to inspire more filmmakers to take a shot.Opened nationally July 21, 2023.",9,Oppenheimer
"Dr. J Robert Oppenheimer the creator of Atomic Bomb and his role in Manhattan Project in R&D for Nuclear weapon. The movie is the Biography of Dr. Oppenheimer.Cillian Murphy portrayed brilliantly as Dr. J Robert Oppenheimer. His eyes and face expressions were outstanding.Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, Florence pugh and the rest of the cast were fantastic.This is a very matured Realistic 'A+' movie that is made ones in life time.Cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema is phenomenal. Each frame of the movie looks breathtaking especially in IMAX screen. He is indeed one of the masterful Cinematographer.Ludwig Goransson Back Ground Music is heart thumping and beautifully sound designed.Editing by Jennifer Lame is fantastic. The 3 hours run time of the movie felt like shorter.Christopher Nolan is one of the Masterclass movie maker who exist. He is the writer and the creator of this monumental.The Practical effects and doing an explosion of A bomb for a movie is absolutely insane (in a positive sense). He is the Gutsy remarkable film maker who can make the movie experience to be remembered forever.Oppenheimer deserves 10/10A true Masterpiece in all aspects.",10,Oppenheimer
"Everybody involved with the production of 'Oppenheimer (2023)' is working at the highest conceivable level, practicing their craft so adeptly that it's hard to express just how impressive their efforts truly are. There isn't a weak link in the entire chain; everything is at the highest standard imaginable. The writing, the directing, the editing, the score, the cinematography, the sound design, the special effects, the costuming, the set design, the casting, and the acting - oh, the acting - is all impeccable. This film is exactly what it was always intended to be. If it doesn't clean up at the Oscars, I'll eat my shoe* or, more realistically, I'll be very surprised.However, that doesn't mean it's perfect. More specifically, it doesn't mean it moves me enough to declare it one of the best movies ever made (as so many others seem to have). It isn't even Nolan's best, although there is a good argument to be made that it's his most accomplished. Essentially, the dilemma at play here is that this is undeniably prestige filmmaking that's pretty much technically flawless, but it's just missing that intangible oomf to catapult it into any of my all-timer lists.Some of its weak points, most - if not all - of which are choices rather than mistakes, are as follows: the sound mixing, while markedly improved from 'Tenet (2020)', is balanced so it favours music and sound effects over dialogue, which is fine and dandy for the big explosion-type stuff but is sometimes irritating when it comes to the quieter dialogue-driven scenes (which take up 80% of the runtime); the editing is pretty relentless and the entire affair feels a bit like a trailer, which in turn makes the feature feel even longer than it already is (at three hours, that's not something you want) and can sometimes keep you at a bit of a distance from the narrative; the opening is quite underwhelming because it feels more like a rote history lesson than an actual story and is far more generic than the movements it precedes (thankfully it isn't too long before the flick finds its feet); sometimes, the actual mechanics of what's going on get lost in the background and, as such, the Manhattan Project almost feels ancillary to the narrative's exploration of the politics surrounding the protagonist's vague association with the communist party; the picture doesn't delve into Oppenheimer's psyche as much as it should considering that the sequences in which it does are easily the most successful in the entire affair; and the female representation is noticeably really weak across the board, with Florence Pugh's well-performed but perfunctory character - as crude as it sounds - only really existing to show her breasts and give the male hero something to feel guilty about.Having said that, there are plenty of things to like here (as my first paragraph ought to suggest). Nolan's never been an especially formalistic filmmaker when it comes to specific scenes and the way in which they're crafted, as his formalistic achievements are usually reserved for the ways in which he structures his films (i.e. How he plays around with chronology to, for instance, create a sense of escalating tension or put you in the headspace of the protagonist). That's true of this picture, too, but here he also tries his hand at some notably fanciful sequences that utilise surrealist elements to further enhance the feeling they're intended to provoke (and, in some cases, represent). One of these scenes, in particular, even outshines the inevitable trinity test, which is itself a masterclass in ratcheting tension and explosive payoffs (pun intended). That this artistic moment prevents the movie's most obvious attraction - the impact of which can be measured not in kilotons, but in megatons - from being the actual highlight of the overall affair is a testament to the sheer success of Nolan's directional decisions. That's not to downplay the tangible awe inspired by the dropping of the bomb in New Mexico, which truly is a sight (and sound) to behold. It's incredibly impressive that the effects were mainly captured in camera, using a variety of techniques such as miniature photography as full scale pyrotechnics. The sound (or, at least, some of it) was also apparently not recreated in a studio but recorded on set. For how almost nonchalantly these visceral elements are presented, appearing as just another part of the world crafted for the overall immersive experience, they're undoubtedly and almost unimaginably astounding.The film is a veritable who's who of Hollywood: almost every character who pops up, no matter how small their role in the overall story, is portrayed by someone recognisable. There are more stars in this thing than in the night sky and the acting is absolutely brilliant across the board. Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Benny Safdie, Tom Conti, Josh Hartnett, Jason Clarke and David Krumholtz are highlights, but Robert Downey Jr. Is an awards-worthy standout who comes second only to the picture's phenomenal leading man. Cillian Murphy commands the screen with his understated yet powerhouse performance, carrying the weight of the atomic-sized affair with ease. If he doesn't win the Best Leading Actor Oscar, there's something seriously wrong.Even at three hours in length, there really isn't all that much filler. Perhaps it's because of the way it's edited, but it feels as though the events it depicts have actually been somewhat truncated to fit the runtime. Sometimes, it feels as though it's been on for longer than it actually has simply because it crams so much into its duration. On the flip side, huge chunks of it also occasionally zip by in what seems to be an instant. The pacing doesn't leave much breathing room, which ensures there's never a dull moment - at the cost of there never really being time to fully digest what's happening in any given scene (it actually doesn't even feel as though there are individual scenes, per se). Even though it is arguably a bit too long, it's also hard to pinpoint exactly what ought to have been removed to reduce its length. It tells its story in a fairly efficient way and features a number of key turning points that prevent it from ever feeling stale. It's often really compelling and, although it obviously has segments that are far more successful than others, it's generally engaging even during its driest moments. It helps that it's a fairly nuanced exploration of its heavy topic, dancing through the moral minefield of its subject matter without ever pushing its own opinion on its audience. It knows there are no easy answers and, by pushing you to confront your own feelings on the issue and perhaps even attempt to decipher what you'd do in the same situation, it manages to convey somewhat of an understanding of the absolute impossibility of the situation it depicts. It creates a great deal of empathy for its protagonist, someone who is easy to blame for the atrocities committed with the weapon he is credited as being the father of, without attempting to absolve him. It might make you reconsider your opinion of him, but it definitely doesn't force you to.In the end, though, this does lack that hard-to-identify element that would make it really resonate with me. I can't quite say what it is, but something stops it from truly hitting me in my core. It isn't all that emotionally affecting and sometimes it isn't wholly gripping. It's often thrilling, but it doesn't quite sink its hooks into you enough to stay with you for long after it's over. I'm not pining to watch it again and I don't think it will remain seared in my brain for too long. It's great, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't quite rise to the standard of Nolan's best work, even if there's an argument to be made that it's his most accomplished.*I definitely won't be eating my shoe, no matter what happens at the Oscars. Who do you think I am? Werner Herzog?",8,Oppenheimer
"Imagine a fire that you brought from the heaven and you give that fire to human , and that fire is used by humans to burn this world.Oppenheimer is not an easy historical character to play, he is a historical character full of regret and guilt. However, Murphy plays this character perfectly, his eyes filled with those emotios, the way he responds to every other supporting character's utterances is simply outstanding. Even if his only response was eye movement, or a blank stare in an uncertain direction, Everything can be understood. Also, His body gestures also complement his extraordinary acting.""They won't fear it, until they understand it, the won't understand it, until they use it."" A sentence that explains the dangers of a nuclear bomb. And the way he conveyed it really looked real and as if he already understood what was going to happen.He also played Oppenheimer's flaws perfectly, He's a pretty selfish and sometimes rebellious guy. Committing adultery with a woman who is not his wife, and has feelings that are very binding with his that girl, When the woman's death, we can see that Oppenheimer was devastated.Then for the scoring, It's really amazing. First it sound so grand, The atomic bomb is a very grandiose thing, But over time the music got louder and louder, shows a very deep fear.The sound effects also produce a feeling for the audience to feel the horror of atomic bomb. The stomping of those feet against the wooden floor couldn't escape my head until now.Lastly is the cinematography, every angle is taken perfectly, the practical effects are really pleasing to the eye. The approach to Murphy's face in the final scene literally describes Oppenheimer's entire life. The explosion was also really grandiose.Christopher Nolan literally describes it all perfectly, and I have absolutely no words to compliment this man. If you want to feel Christopher Nolan's way of seeing the world, watch this film. 3 hours passed without getting bored, like only an hour.That is all from me. Thank you.",10,Oppenheimer
"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.",9,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer has always been regarded by History as an interesting figure for the advancement of scientific discovery. While also being a rather controversial figure for his choices and mankind. Nolans Oppenheimer takes the audience on that dramatic epic of ethical proportions, in many ways, it is conflicting yet still fantasizing in every way Throughout the movie, you see the psyche and internal conflict, personal Matters left facing. The themes of the era with the red scare with McCarthyism, the paranoia and the shadow hanging over following Oppenheimer throughout. What the influence of such a weapon carries? The pressure put on a man. If the possibility of the enemy having such a thing, is it better to act before they do? Are the ones who claim to fight for you the ones to trust themselves? This is a movie about Mankind, not just the bomb being built, or the overall progress much of the war. Much like say The Imitation Game focusing on the war being fought behind the battle line. This is a very heavy dialogue-driven focus on the aspects of science and politics, and the psychological of Oppenheimer, but all of this things investing as you jump around these different time frames. Primary because of the great reforming given by like Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey who gives probably the second-best performance in this ensemble cast. With most of his films, the cinematography is done amazingly as well as the visuals that emphasize of fission and chain reactions of the panning landshot the use of and the lack of color, and of course the big payoff of the bomb and the impact of all, and the Explosions Performances that on the big screen can't be compared to watching it at home.",8,Oppenheimer
"""Oppenheimer"" or ""How the Father of the Atomic Bomb learned to start worrying and Hate the Bomb""In this story of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer it's not just about his role in the development of the atomic bomb at Los Alamos, New Mexico, but also the machiavellian manoeuvres going on to discredit him in the United States.The downfall of Oppenheimer is the main thrust of this story arc, long after he helped his government build the A Bombs that landed on Hiroshima and Nagasaki killing thousands of innocent civilians to end World War 2 even though Adolph Hitler was already dead and the Germans had surrendered.""Oppenheimer"" is the most promising and prominent Oscar bait so far of 2023 for Best Picture, Screenplay, Sound Engineering, Actor, Supporting Actor etc.If this doesn't sweep the floor then I don't know what will.Cillian Murphy is outstanding, Robert Downey Jr. Unrecognisable at first and gives a very different performance.It's almost like he's channeling F. Murray Abraham (""Amadeus"") and ""My Left Foot"" star Daniel Day Lewis.In fact, the way this film plays out reminded me of the genius of ""Amadeus"".This is one of the most impressive uses of an all-star cast I've ever seen.More often than not the higher the star count the lesser the movie, but director Christopher Nolan (""Dark Knight"") manages to herd his cattle even better than Alfred Hitchcock.I'm talking about Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh, Gary Oldman, Emily Blunt, Josh Hartnett, Ben Affleck, Matthew Modine, Rami Malek & Aussie Jason Clarke to name a few.These actors transformed themselves for their roles superbly.The only actor noticeably absent from this ensemble was Michael Caine who's been in many Nolan movies.Somehow no CGI was harmed in the making of this movie...none at all, despite the awesome Visual SFX.It's not the first time Murphy & Nolan have worked, it's their sixth collaboration, but it is Cillians first time as the lead in one of Christopher's movies as the American theoretical physicist and Project Director of The Manhattan Project to create the first nuclear weapons of mass destruction.Plus I tips me hat to composer Ludwig Gorannson for his score, which takes this movie to another level.Special shout out also to cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema who worked with Nolan on ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk"" and ""Tenet"".""Oppenheimer"" is based on the biographical book ""American Prometheus"" and when Nolan saw the cover art on the book he could only see Murphy in this titular role.Warning: Nudity & Sex scenes (in a movie about scientist nerds...I know right!)
After sitting through 3 intense hours of what could have been dry fodder in the hands of lesser people (it's very wordy dialogue centric so please pay attention) I can understand why ""Oppenheimer"" was one of the most anticipated movies of the year.I saw this in The Lounge/Gold Class so I can't begin to imagine how mind blowing ""Oppenheimer"" will look and sound in its intended IMAX format and for the first time ever Kodak invented Black and White IMAX film just for this movie.This is possibly the best, most important movie ever given the rumblings of war mongering in the world today.As J. Robert Oppenheimer states in this movie, ""I don't know if we can be trusted with such a weapon. But I know the Nazis can't.""
This could possibly be Director Christopher Nolans Magnum Opus!",10,Oppenheimer
"In a world that's problematic you're perplexing, spending your time with particles, that are complexing, pushing boundaries to their limits, the fission/fusion of new physics, with the clashes, conflicts, contests you elicit. As a consequence you setup two big bangs, when you execute through governmental plans, although this story does not dwell, on the hell that you propel, to the people who are wiped out in Japan. In the end we're left to ponder motivations, of those who seek to play, with torments and damnations, of those who hide inside the shadows, pulling strings in Emperor's clothes, as they plot to raze the cornerstone foundations.",8,Oppenheimer
"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",7,Oppenheimer
"God what an absolute mess. To all the people saying ""you need to pay attention and have your brain fully switched on""... that doesn't make this ""intelligent film"". It makes it an overcomplicated nightmare. Nolan's movies have gone so far downhill since Dunkirk. The mess of 3 timelines is not needed for the entirety of every film. It works well for the majority of inception, the climax of the dark knight, parts of interstellar- but this? Not at all.Nolan desperately needs a writing partner that tells him ""NO"". This film would've been so much stronger with 40 less minutes of chatter before the bomb test, and 30 minutes less after the test. I absolutely LOVE long, ""boring"" movies. I'm a freak for Malick or Reichardt, but this? I would've left if I wasn't with friends.Nolan has a difficult time when directing anything slightly out of his comfort zone. The scene of Florence Pugh in the chair during the interview, the overdramtic yells of Emily Blunt, both had me biting my fist in cringe.No amount of quick cuts or dramatic music were able to convince me I was being entertained.",4,Oppenheimer
"Although the time passed quickly, ultimately, Oppenheimer has left me disappointed. The problem with this film is that it can't decide which story it tries to tell - building the bomb or the inquiry of the national security committee. Both of those stories are depicted well, Nolan uses nice narrative devices to locate the characters in their currently depicted temporal location, etc. However, the cheap moral that the film concludes with has been beaten to death and because of that it undermines everything the script tried to achieve. The film didn't leave me speechless and a rather poorly executed sequence of the denotation doesn't really justify the historic development of a black and white IMAX film stock.",8,Oppenheimer
"One of the most anticipated films of this year and who better to deliver the film none other than Christopher Nolan. Nolan makes the audience think, and I think for me at least it will click better with a second viewing much like DUNKIRK or TENENT. Nevertheless the shoulders of this film is carried by Cillian Murphy who finally gets to showcase his talents as a lead. He's always been a treat to watch on screen and I'm very happy for him. He deserves all the praise.Murphy channels Oppenheimer incredibly well. He acts with his eyes and his face. Throughout the film you're not in doubt with what he's thinking and what he's feeling as he never really expresses his feelings until the aftermath of his invention. Murphy effortlessly anchors the entire 3 hour film and it is a surefire Oscar nomination. He's consistently brilliant in almost anything he does and I think this film will put him on top of Everest.Robert Downey Jr. I think could potentially get an nomination as well. After an incredible decade of being Iron Man, he's able to show off his other talents reminiscent of his pre-Iron Man days. He disappears into the role of Lewis Strauss and he takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, patiently biding his time to strip Oppenheimer of his good reputation. To my surprise, Josh Harnett has a meaty role as Ernest Lawrence and it's nice to see him on screen again. Matt Damon brings his A-game as Major General Leslie Groves. He's a no-nonsense military character, but also rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. The unlikely alliance between the two is a treat to watch as Murphy and Damon have a good dynamic together.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh contribute to the story as his wife Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. To me I saw these two as a reminder of Oppenheimer's character flaws as he was not perfect. They represented something significant in Oppenheimer's life, Kitty being who he should be with, but Jean being someone he wants to be with. Also being that this is a Nolan film, no part is a small part, so there are a lot of incredibly talented and well recognized actors playing other historic figures and people of importance, so it was kind of fun to see who pops up as who for their glorified, but layered and important cameos.In true Nolan fashion, this isn't a conventional biopic. It's told in non-sequential order highlighting specific points in Oppenheimer's life jumping from places to places. For some this is the make or break for the film. I do think one has to be an experienced viewer of film to keep up with the non-linear storytelling, but again Nolan is very resourceful with the way he does this so it never really feels like you're too lost. I will admit though I do think I would have preferred something a little bit more conventional for my tastes. I liked the flow more when there were moments to marinate things happening in chronological order as opposed to jumping around and to Nolan's credit, he does this near the last hour or so. This is where I also felt the film is at its best when it focused on the psychological thriller aspect. There's one sequence in involving a speech that's particularly terrifying as you can feel Oppenheimer's horror and remorse. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments leading up to the completion of the bomb and when they begin to test it, it is very gripping when you don't expect it to be.Production design is incredible, the attention to detail is also impeccable. Kudos to production designer Ruth De Jong who also has experience in period pieces like THERE WILL BE BLOOD. Creating a look and feel to a time that's long gone may seem so simple and easy to do on the surface, but I cannot imagine the challenges the crew had to face, making sure everything was on point to that era. From costumes, buildings, set design, cars, etc. You feel transported to that time. It's also shot in a way that is also very immersive by Hoyte Van Hoytema, making this his fourth collaboration with Nolan. Music is composed by Ludwig Göransson, who also killed it with BLACK PANTHER and MANDALORIAN. He is definitely going to get some praise for his work here.This film almost touches on greatness, if it were not for it's length and time jumps. The movie is overly dense as it tries to bundle too much of Oppenheimer's pre and post-Trinity life into one movie. I also do think if you're a history buff it will be a more enjoyable experience, but for those who aren't too familiar with the subject, it is something that might be harder to digest with its first viewing. I do personally think somewhere in this film, there is a phenomenal 2.5 hour cut, but OPPENHEIMER is still a powerful biopic that explores and shows the dark side of human nature, powered by a tour-de-force performance from Cillian Murphy. Another landmark achievement from Christopher Nolan.8/10.",10,Oppenheimer

"Saw Oppenheimer today on an IMAX screen. I'm an emotional wreck but also buzzing with delight! Finally we get an intelligent, mature film for grown-ups, with scientific wonder, espionage intrigue & political drama all In one. Superb ensemble acting & production. Nolan's pinnacle.One reviewer said they found it a bit too conversation heavy, but for me that's no problem. All The President's Men, The Conversation and JFK are all 'talk-heavy' and I loved those too.I appreciate why many folks found Inception, Tenet & Interstellar a bit hard to follow, but I don't think this is as much of a head scratcher. Yes we jump back & forth across a few time periods in Oppenheimer's life, but once we've seen them all (only 4 or 5), it's fine.I sat in the front row of the IMAX cinema so I could feel like I was absorbed into the film. The sound design is bloody amazing and during a few moments it thumped through my body, it felt wonderful! Superb music score by Ludwig Göransson too.If there's any justice in the acting awards season, whenever they start, Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr deserve a stack of nominations, two particularly outstanding performances in a film crammed full of impressive acting displays. I was also absolutely delighted to see Tom Conti back on the big screen, this time as Albert Einstein. A superb actor who I've admired for decades. I'd avoid any reviews if you want surprises on which actors turn up, that weren't featured in the trailer. A couple of unexpected cameos were lovely to see!Overall a 10/10 production, bloody loved it, going back for a 2nd viewing on IMAX after my next payday!",8,Oppenheimer
"First off, the dialogues are actually audible, quite clear, happy that they mended this in comparison to Nolan's last outing Tenet.Secondly, a captivating story told in a even more captivating way.The acting is perhaps best of the year so far, Oscar nominations galore.I saw it on a digital IMAX screen, very pristine and filmy.Sound, cinematography and score are stand outs too.Only thing is, this film would have been a even better mini series.The run time and intense dialogues/ intrigues can be quite draining to the viewer.As a Dutchman I noticed that, Oppenheimer did not speak Dutch in the film, it sounded like an Irishman trying to speak German. Half a point deduction.Not Nolan's best but it is up there, like the bellowing smoke from a nuclear explosion.8.5/10Let's go to James Bond 007 next, Nolan!",10,Oppenheimer
"This movie is not for people who watch the phone every 5 minutes, can't concentrate more time than a TiK Tok video or not trained into watching magnificent details.I grew up watching real movies, and I am able to disconnect from the world for 2-3 hours, and consequently enjoy a great movie like Openheimer. Are you?First, all the cast makes an acting masterclass. Cillian and Robert are incredible. Real, gritty and scary portrait of human being.Second, cinematography, music, storytelling and scenarios are simply amazing. Details counts, and here you need to watch carefully everything to understand the movie as a whole great masterpiece.Last, camera work, direction and script are superb. I was inmerse in a great trip from beginning till the end. Nolan's best movie since Batman ones.To add, I can't remember last time a movie fulfilled me as Openheimer. So, overall a masterpiece to enjoy if you love real cinema.",10,Oppenheimer
Speechless this movie had a very good sound design good visual that will blow your Mind and you will getting the best score in this movie and one thing you all saying this is boring?

"I can't help but wonder what this movie would've looked like if it had been directed by a different filmmaker, and I believe that it probably would've been better. Like most Nolan films this lacks emotion. Oppenheimer was a stoic man for sure but he had moments of catharsis throughout his life. Having read the book this film is based on (American Prometheus) I noticed that many of the relationships that affected his (Oppie's) life and career, and his hypnotic charisma were sadly missing in this film. The whole idea of the book, more over the whole point of Oppie's infamous testimony, was to explain the actions by shedding light on the man. I'm disappointed to say that this is no tale of the man, rather a tale of the Los Alamos project and a couple of testimonies. The film may have been packed with beautiful imagery, riveting score and decent performances, but it's painfully obvious that it lacks heart.The length is another issue. There seems to be a trend in Hollywood to tell simple and short stories over an extremely extensive period, and to tell longer and more complicated stories over a short period. This falls into the latter category. Nothing is flushed out. We jump from scene to scene with no context. Other than Oppie every character felt insignificant, including his wife and his adversary, both played by brilliant actors who are shamefully wasted here. This film could've greatly benefited from a longer runtime. It is hard not to compare this with 2014's Imitation Game and 2010's Social Network, which did a lot more character work and did good jobs at portraying emotions.Having said all that I did very much enjoy this film. Certain visual and sound effects were used to perfection, complementing the theme in a truly awesome way. Although being a massive Nolan fan and and having read the book (which helps in putting scattered scenes into context) I'm sure this is somewhat biased.If this had been made by another filmmaker I would've given it a 7.Had I not read the book I would've given it a 6.But alas I give it an 8!",10,Oppenheimer
"This intercuts the development of the atomic bomb(which is where the simmering tension arises from, not the Nolan staple of ill intentioned guys with guns. It is absolutely true that this is mostly made up of guys talking without anything dramatic happening at the same time, no heists, interrogations, death-defying behavior, and it is gripping from start to finish), the hearing to determine if Oppenheimer would keep his security clearance(which smoothly enables this to work in any incident that was deemed vital to the story of him), and the hearing to determine if Lewis Strauss joins the government(which does a solid job of contrasting the two men and their values).The three hours really flew by, honestly it felt like it was half the length. It really underlines how Robert felt about the nuke, and how those feelings changed significantly over time. The massive guilt he felt after Hiroshima and Nagasaki seems like the kind of thing that you couldn't possibly properly communicate. This makes it inescapable. Not everyone will respond well to how it renders visual what people are thinking, personally I thought it worked incredibly well. This does require some knowledge of World War 2 and the Red Scare. You don't need to already know how fission and the like work. That is explained well herein.I really appreciate how relevant this is. It is in part exploring escalation in war(today we're seeing it with drones - the line ""the weapons we have, we tend to end up using"" is chilling) and manipulation in politics(a huge problem right now, one of the main reasons that we are struggling to solve potentially world ending problems like climate change, despite how much we can do technologically). Some have taken issue with how it deals with Communism. It doesn't make the Soviet Union seem even remotely appealing, on the contrary, it just acknowledges the appeal of socialism, as well as the intense government pressure against it at the time. I've seen some call the sex scene awkward, when in reality it's meant to be. The reason that it's handled the way that it is is to underline how scrutinized the titular character became, and criticize that.I recommend this to everyone that believes they can handle the subject matter. 10/10.",7,Oppenheimer
"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth.",4,Oppenheimer
"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due. A 10 used to meant perfection, not just the glare or the sparkles. Remember not all that shines is gold.",10,Oppenheimer
"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.",10,Oppenheimer
"Christopher Nolan just stamped his foot print into cinema history as an all time great. It is as if each film he's made has just been a building block leading him to conduct this masterpiece. Oppenheimer is Nolan's finest work. Murphy delivers a sublime performance, reaching a threshold very few actors ever will. Next year's Oscar statue can be put into escrow for Cillian. Nolans three hour plutonium dense genius-of-physics, magnum opus does for the atomic bomb what Spielberg did for sharks at the beach. It seems Christopher Nolan has turned in a tour de force that has vaporized the competition. In fact, Scorsese's 'flowers of the killer moon' may be the only threat of a rival for best picture. However, that may be the toughest act to follow since Einstein's theory of relativity.",10,Oppenheimer
"This was one of my most anticipated films of the last few years and unbelievably it did not disappoint in any way.After the lacklustre, confusing and very hollow experience of TENET, I thought Nolan had lost his way a bit. I assumed that, despite knowing that Nolan is one of the greatest filmmakers to have ever lived, I was very wary of Oppenheimer and thought it would not be as good as I hoped it to be.How wrong I was. Oppenheimer is a masterpiece, Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus. It is an astounding work of complexity, uniqueness and originality the likes of which I have never seen before. Nolan has outdone himself - it feels like every piece of work Nolan has done in the past has been leading to this film. The non-linear narrative, the visual/special effects, the character building, the story structure, all of it comes together seamlessly to create a truly awe inspiring experience.Cillian Murphy gives the best performance of his career and one of the finest of the last few years. Every time he is on screen he is captivating, alluring and haunting. The film is properly titled - it is not a story about the bomb, it is a story about how it's creation impacted Oppenheimer and Cillian completely embodies the role. His eyes - his eyes and the look on his face allow you to view this man as a tortured soul, a man who knows he did his duty and did it for the right reasons but who ultimately regrets his life due to the legacy he will leave behind.Oppenheimer is outstanding in every regard - amazing music, beautiful cinematography, gorgeous visuals, a brilliant cast, a sharp and smart script. Oppenheimer is definitely, so far in my opinion, the best film of 2023.",10,Oppenheimer
"From the top tier cast to the cinematography this movie is a masterpiece. The source of historical events of Los Alamos, project Manhattan is recreated in fantastic detail. What I like the most is the fact it's no CGI. Absolute Boss production here with the IMAX camera x special effects. You don't wanna miss out on that movie. Color range with black & white expresses the objective perception and colorful the subjective perspective from Oppenheimer. I'm convinced that I probably missed even more hidden details.Cilian Murphy deserve this spot where he is right now. He's one of the best actors in the world. His best work ever. I can't single out every other actors work here the list wouldn't stop.The score of the movie was produced by Ludwig Göransson. He did an amazing job as usual in his previous work.There come scenes when you spot an actor you were not aware of being here and that's so awesome the way this movie mastered the difficulty of not wasting an actors skill set.Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors of all time. His way of making movies is unique.",10,Oppenheimer
"I am a fan of Christopher Nolan's work, and this one lived up to his best standards. Covering almost forty years, from Oppenheimer as a student in England and Germany, to the unsatisfying honors of his later years, Nolan, cast and crew, have labored to create a portrait of a man , full of flaws, but smarter than I can imagine, and placed him among other men of similar brilliance in a way that illuminates them all. And like watching Penn & Teller do the cup-and-ball trick, I see exactly what he does and still can't catch him doing it, any more than I recognized Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss, who turns into the villain of the piece.It's early to start predicting Oscar nominations, and Nolan's pictures have been slighted in the past. However, one nomination I feel confident about is that Luisa Abel will be nominated for make-up, as she ages her characters through their lifetimes.Nolan's movies encompass big themes and often distorted views of time. This would seem to render them too highbrow for popularity yet they are popular. They challenge the audience without insulting him. They don't indulge in bafflegab to offer a fig leaf to their nonsense, but explain things in terms he can understand (I omit TENET from this discussion), just as the scientists use language they can understand. Nolan as a film maker is the type of craftsman I try to be as a writer: engaging, entertaining, making his points without talking down, and leaving the audience a little happier and more knowledgeable than when he started. My only dissatisfaction with this movie is that he is so much better at his craft than I at mine.",10,Oppenheimer
"I went in with very high expectations and somehow left being more blown away than I thought possible .First of all - the writing. So well scripted- the dialogue , pacing and format all played hand in hand to create an engaging and thoughtful presentation of an incredible story in a way that let you discover Nolan's impressions of the story even if you already knew about the history . The moralistic dilema and presentation leaves room to make your own conclusions , draw your own opinions while reminding us both good and evil come in all forms .The black and white filming was very well integrated and it was such a cool way to move back and forth between timelines - ultimately colliding near the end . I loved that the black and white was the current whereas the past was color . The past in color was the story as history is written , as people remember , what memory tells us as individuals. The present in black and white is a search for truth - when they collide it's a reminder as color infiltrates the present that ultimate truth can never be known .The acting for characters was astounding - you did not truly like any of them - another salute to the presentation of the premise of this movie - no clear answers . Salute to Pugh and Blunt who were absolutely astounding in the roles they played .Another huge element to this movie which deserves praise and accolades is the incredible sound production and editing . The scene where the test takes place is especially well done in this respect . The glimpses into Oppenheimers mind were also audibly very powerful and showed a broken and conflicted soul ling before the creation of the bomb .I could go on and on - but this is what film should be . Help us reflect on humanity , on ourselves and remind us that film is one of the most powerful mediums on earth .",10,Oppenheimer
"Christopher Nolan has truly outdone himself with this gripping biographical drama. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer was nothing short of extraordinary; he brought an incredible depth and complexity to the character, making the genius physicist feel hauntingly real.Nolan's direction was masterful as always, seamlessly blending history, science, and emotion. The visuals were breathtaking, transporting us back to the era of the Manhattan Project with stunning attention to detail. The use of practical effects and practical sets added a sense of authenticity that further immersed me in the story.One aspect that stood out was the film's exploration of Oppenheimer's moral dilemmas and the weight of the decisions he faced. The screenplay didn't shy away from the ethical implications of his work on the atomic bomb, forcing the audience to confront the morally gray areas of scientific progress during wartime.What impressed me the most was Nolan's ability to present complex scientific concepts in an accessible way without oversimplifying them. The film catered to both science enthusiasts and general audiences, striking a perfect balance between intellectual stimulation and emotional resonance.While Oppenheimer may not be an action-packed thriller like some of Nolan's previous works, its slow and deliberate pacing allowed for a profound and thought-provoking experience. By the final act, I found myself questioning the moral implications of scientific advancements and reflecting on the consequences of our choices as a species.",10,Oppenheimer
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",6,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer's marketing campaign hammered two messages into our heads. First, that we had to watch it in the biggest screen possible. And second, that audiences had come out of test projections deeply affected or in tears. Having watched the film, I can confidently say none of those promises are true.For a Christopher Nolan film, Oppenheimer is very unspectacular, with only a handful of atomic explosion images, which -unfortunately- are not new and will not impact anyone in the audience. And it's also quite unemotional. You leave the theatre feeling like you just went through a (rather long) history lesson, but not particularly devastated. Because the film chooses -as is often the case with Nolan- a clinical approach to its subject, and the contradictions and dilemmas of Oppenheimer are observed the way one observes an insect, instead of a human character. It looks as if Nolan were trying to compete in intelligence with the scientists in his film. This is Nolan's consistent flaw. He is so insecure that he is only happy when he has proven to everyone how intelligent he is. To do this, in addition to the ice cold way in which he treats his characters, he throws into Oppenheimer his signature mixing of time periods, always afraid people will see him as mediocre if he ever just followed the chronological order of events. And in this case, he adds black and white to one of the time periods of the movie, which makes the whole thing a little cheesy.But as always too, Nolan shows control of the medium, and delivers some strong moments with virtuoso camera movements, broad shots and a great score. Most enjoyable in the film is the performance of its extraordinary cast. Every last one of them is outstanding, starting with Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer.The balance is a bit of an average film, undeniably very long and a bit boring, despite the talent of the filmmaker and the cast.",5,Oppenheimer
"""They won't fear it until they understand it. And they won't understand it until they've used it. Theory will take you only so far."" J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy)The ""it"" is the atomic bomb, for which Oppenheimer was called ""The Father."" Writer/director Christopher Nolan has adapted the authoritative 2005 bio ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Nolan, surveying Oppenheimer's life and especially his leadership of The Manhattan Project, has crafted a harrowing story deeply embedded in our history as Oppenheimer developed the two atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki that helped end WWII.Yet, this film is not really about the making of the bombs-it is rather about the turmoil surrounding Oppenheimer with such weighty questions about killing tens of thousands of civilians with the bombs, whether that would force Japan to surrender, and whether or not he was a Communist.Nolan keeps it favorable to history only now and then emphasizing interactions that cannot be verified such as conversations with his wife, the alcoholic Kitty (Emily Blunt), and his mistress, Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). Murphy underplays masterfully Oppenheimer's struggles while he carefully considers each challenge, like the scientist he plays. Just as upending are the anti -Communist attacks that dogged him through his professional life.Along with cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, Nolan captures the vast loneliness of the new Mexico desert using 65 mm film projected in 70mm. As in Dunkirk (2017), Nolan uses the process to mirror the magnitude of the subject and the intellectual excitement following Einstein's 1915 publishing of his theory of general relativity-it's the chalkboards that announce mankind's precipitate changes and provide the intellectual excitement eclipsing even that of the bomb itself.Nolan's mixing black and white and then color helps to relieve the monotony for some of the film's three hours but mostly shows the upheaval of his life, especially the last third in black and white, where the antisemitic Red Scare threatened his legacy as scientist and humanitarian.His turn as critic of nuclear war toward the end of his life was not without attendant compromise of his achievements. Perhaps his thoughts as he saw the first test mushroom cloud said it all about how his research for the bomb changed him and the world:""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."" ""Oppenheimer"" is the best movie of the year so far and one of the great war movies of all time.",10,Oppenheimer
"Christopher Nolan, once again, uses astonishing film techniques to embark the audience on an other worldly adventure. He brings to light the historical significance of the Manhattan project and Los Alamos through the scientific and political background of such a unique town portrayed with perfection by such actors as Cillian Murphy and Matt Damon. By using Los Alamos and New Mexico as a film location for the film, Nolan is able to portray what life would have been for Oppenheimer and other scientists with their families around the time of the Trinity test.As someone who grew up in Los Alamos, I could arguably say that Oppenheimer correctly highlights the history of the town and the creation of the atomic bomb alongside Nolan's own creative input to emphasise Oppenheimer's story.Cillian Murphy delivers such a vast and emotionally compelling role by highlighting the moral dilemma Oppenheimer himself faced and on that we deal with in todays age.For being a 3 hr plus film the pacing is incredible and an average movie goer can endure such horror, mystery, and drama all in one storyline that fills holes at the end created in the beginning.",9,Oppenheimer
"LIKES:The Presentation:
-Oppenheimer had a lot happen in his life, and this movie does its best to capture it without being too historical
-Nolan takes the underlying a story, a case, and uses it as a guiding line that helps tie together to the big parts and summarize his life. It works, and presents the evidence in this visual style and storytelling that works.-There is some Hollywood mixing that might stretch the truth, but it's balanced enough that I can't say it was annoying in conveying the struggles of this time period.-The result is a historical biography that moves, very important for a three hour period, and found myself engaged to listen to the tales of the father of quantum physics in America.The Acting:
-No surprise, this is going to be a contender for best acting, and rightfully so given the performances presented in this movie.-Every single person, big or small, has this atmosphere that works. It blends Hollywood dramatic theater with biography and conveys relationships, tensions, and dynamics that are closer to the pulse of reality than some other dynamics.-The tension of the case is conveyed in everyone, and I loved this buildup of so many sides on this issue and it worked well.-Damon is great, his range of acting continues to impress me and the way he has such control over character nuances. This pushed him to several different levels and found his engagement and evolution, quite awesome.-Blunt started out okay for me, one of my top actresses feeling a little sidelined and conveying an okay character. The later acts show her style though and I loved watching this woman deliver these lines and emotions with such a top notch level of acting that spices up acts 3 and 4.-Murphy is the one to keep eyes on though. The man's complexity has evolved way past Red Eye, his conveyance of mannerisms, quirks, obsessions, and genius creepy and yet entrapping. He plays well with everyone, hits these roles of a changing career on high cylinders, and makes a historical character intriguing to look more into.-All in all, this is probably one of the stronger qualities of the film, but there is more to dive into.The Visuals/Cinematography:
-Nolan is all about telling stories on a lot of levels, and visual sensations are a key component.-Oppenheimer has fantastic camera work, using angles, lighting, technology, and planning to find the optimum angle to give you the best of the situation.-The changing of filters for various parts adds this nuance that gives subtle changes, adding emotion and messages the likes I did not expect, while keeping me awake.-And the fact that it actively adapts to the character with hyper focus and realism, while still adding touches of grainy visuals of the times, is homage paid well.The Sound:
-Thank the Lord, this movie got the sound right and proved editing can still be done.-Nolan's team gives crisp dialog, easy to understand and listen, without getting drowned out by other sounds.-It's the Imax worthy piece of it, the musical scores adding that emotion going to do well on top notch speakers, while the resounding booms and other effects get an added life.-Another level of immersion, the movie really used the budget well to make sure you get all the information you need to follow, and perhaps cast your own vote before the end.The Story Pieces Chosen:
-For the most part, Oppenheimer's legacy is tied to the infamous device he crafted, but does that make the most interesting character for all?-Nolan seems to agree it doesn't, and like a good autobiography, finds snippets of his life to ingrain and add a bit more of the ""good stuff"" to enhance the character.-Facets of his life come into play at times, adding extra tests and impasses for him to work around while coordinating so much.-Friendships, relationships, and philosophies conveyed to some extent (though accurately I have no idea) that gives you more than just the science laden man you might think.-It works well for me and should help broaden the audience who will see that movie.-And to have details in all these components, both invention and non-invention, are finding a balance that is surprisingly well, though not as perfect as some might say.The Message:
-Outside of Batman, Nolan's work is often very much ingrained in symbolism, morals, and some assessments of characters that works.-And Oppenheimer is loaded with that. A fantastic movie that tests the fortitude of the human emotion and make us question how much we should push the boundaries.-While a tad heavy at times with some lines, the movie is beautifully done to really show the horrors of progress and the good and bads that we must sometimes weigh.-It adds extra edge to the movie, and again gives you that amazing investment for your time, which again works super well with everything.DISLIKES:More Character Balance:
-The movie has A LOT of names tied to it, and I won't lie that they aren't all in the movie to the same degree, so don't be surprised if your favorite is on and off in less than 30 minutes.-I mentioned Blunt before, but that evens out, but others, you have to be ready to hold tight to the moments they are in, and dive into books more with their engagement.-I would have liked more balance, integration, conveyance, and a few more moments that I wanted to see were absent. Inclusion would have bloated this film more, but a part of me would have loved more time with several characters.The Presentation Is Odd At First:
-Walking into the movie I asked if I had missed something.-The opening is very interesting and you have to be ready for that growth pain of the unique presentation, as you quickly go through his early life during this opening case.-About 20 minutes in, the movie evens out and I was able to understand the presentation style and where we were at. So if you can wade through the confusion at the start, you'll be fine.The Run Time:
-It's 3 hours and at times it feels like it when you hit the transition moments that are odd, which slow down the pace.-While most of the stuff is then fine, the last twenty to thirty minutes are the slow parts of the movie and felt the longest. It's important, but... it just feels bloated, long, and very drawn out, that I was ready to go.-True it was hour 5 of a movie, but there were other facets more detail would be welcomed for me, like projects and bombs, instead of seeing this complex endgame. But... it's symbolic and fitting to the story so that helps blunt the time dilation the final effects have.The Audience Entertainment?-Perhaps the last thing to bring to the audience is that this movie requires you to pay attention.-For those looking for entertainment and getting away, without the realism and politics of the world, this movie can be tough to engage with.-The flashbacks and paying attention, keeping track of the names, it's a lot and this might just get in the way of the enjoyment aspect for some, especially when paired with the run time.-Thus, the movie is good and truly an artistic wonder that sticks out from others, but a general audience may be bored and dock scores if they don't know what they are getting.The VERDICT:
Oppenheimer may be one of the most artistic and impressive movies of the year if not in a long time. Nolan proves once again that there is a medium of art and entertainment, and I was very engaged for much of this historical drama thanks to his directorial guidance. Fantastic acting with a stunning visual and audio collection bring history to life, and getting us engaged in a turning point of human culture. It's a summary of a tremendous man's life, and though it has some areas I want more of, did a nice job covering bases, with a little Hollywood spectacle added. True, it's a marathon and it isn't easy to hit if you are coming off a long day, one of the worst parts about it, but the pace and content are engaging to keep track of if you are looking for a deeper biographical film. Some character balance and pacing could be a tad smoothed out and cut down sure (maybe a director's cut), and it might not be the entertaining escape, but the movie really is worth the merit and praise for me given what it achieves in this genre. Teaching those lessons, with an engaging cast of characters, at a pace and timing that feels mostly complete without too much bloated feeling. Thus, my scores are:Biography/Drama/History: 9.5
Movie Overall: 9.0, maybe an 8.5 at the least.",10,Oppenheimer

Overall, a modern masterpiece that transcends the biopic as Nolan delivers a masterclass in direction, writing, and acting (with Cillian Murphy delivering a career-defining performance) as the movie is breathtaking from top to bottom with how it uses many different elements to help share its true message about the horrors of one's creation (and the implication it may have on the future).Brilliant Direction (The most mature storytelling Nolan has ever displayed as he weaves and controls all the scenes on both a macro and micro-scale to drive the story forward to show his message; this was the Nolan has ever done in getting the most out of his actors as the acting down the cast is amazing to where there are so many actors that have their best performance with this movie; has a more palatable interpretation of his signature Nolan style as he makes the audience think but in a way that they can understand (even if another viewing is needed to provide more clarity)), Incredible Acting (Incredible to Brilliant from Cillian Murphy (A career-defining performance as he truly embodies the role of Oppenheimer and is the real lightning rod for other actors to work off of as his presence really drives the performance of others and moves the story forward), Great to Incredible from Emily Blunt (Plays her role very well as she portrays the trauma and troubled relationship she has with her husband very well, showing the weight of him being passed onto her as the movie goes on), Great from Matt Damon (Plays his role very well and works off of Cillian to help drive the development of the Manhattan Project forward, really acts as the moral bridge between the government and the scientists), Great to Incredible from Robert Downey Jr. (Plays a very multi-dimensional role very well as his polished performance shows the cunning nature politicians can have as they try to be two-faced), Great from Florence Pugh (Does a Great job with the short time she is given as her chemistry with Murphy shows the effort Jean's relationship had on Oppenheimer), Great from Josh Hartnett (My favorite performance out of the secondary cast as his charm really brings personality into the movie that is filled with monotonous scientists), Very Good from Casey Affleck (Given very little screentime but does a very good job in building tension between Murphy in his scenes), Very Good from Rami Malek (A key performance in the movie as he does so much with very little given as he really comes to play in the final moments of the movie), Very Good from Kenneth Branagh (Uses a lot of his experience to play this role as he does well in playing the Dane that has an impact on Oppenheimer's career), Good from Benny Safdie (Kinda the most inexperienced performance of the whole movie but he does a good job in holding his own and building a conflicting relationship with Oppenheimer), Very Good from Jason Clarke (Plays one of the true antagonists of the movie very well as he is a driving presence in the security hearings), Good to Very Good from David Krumholtz (The comedic presence of the movie as he does try to make jokes throughout the movie (the only issue is that the movie is moving so fast there is no time to let the jokes stay and marinate with the audience)), Very Good to Great from Tom Conti (Embodies Albert Einstein very well and it feels like he was perfectly cast as his chemistry with Murphy and his delivery helps show the relationship Oppenheimer had with Einstein), Very Good from Alden Ehrenreich (A surprisingly very good performance from a Nolan composite character as his performance is the real moral lense the audience has to look into the whole situation), Very Good from the rest of the cast (This is an understatement with how good the cast was there is no one bad performance in the entire cast, which is incredible given how deep it is)), Incredible Story (An incredibly dense story that crams many moments in Oppenheimer's life into the film, but uses pace and runtime to make it seem like it may be too short at points as all the story points connect and drive the narrative forward; it is also great to see that they not only spend a lot of time on the Manhattan Project but the aftermath too as that is where the real message of the movie lies; The non-linear storytelling was an homage to Nolan's first break Memento as it helps with showing the consequences of the Manhattan Project), Brilliant Screenplay (One of the best screenplays I have ever witnessed in that the dialogue is so natural yet profound as actors can converse with each other with ease and it is embedded with symbols meant to tell the story; the symbolism is incredibly profound and some of the best I have ever seen in a movie as there are many symbols throughout the movie to help show the message it is trying to present; one of the best uses of foreshadowing I have ever seen as a second watch shows how hesitant the scientists were in creating the bomb given the implications it may have on humanity), Incredible Score (Incredibly complements the movie well and is used very well to build emotion and create pace and tension throughout), Incredible to Brilliant Cinematography (The mix of IMAX cameras with large format 70 MM cameras shows the grandeur of the operation and how larger than life the project was (as well as the aftermath); the mix of color and black-and-white help show different perspective and lenses throughout the movie), Great Sound (The sound editing was incredible as the sounds they used to create the explosions (and the lack of sounds at some point) help build tensions throughout the movie; the mixing of dialogue was an improvement from the previous Nolan movies but it still is an issue as there are some moments were the dialog is hard to hear), Incredible Editing (The cuts were incredibly fluid and some of the best work I have ever seen as they were so mesmerizing the watch on the big screen), Incredible to Brilliant Visual Effects (Some of the best effects work I have ever seen as the use of practical effects over CGI show the capabilities filmmakers have without the use of expensive technology), Great Production Design (This is specifically for Los Alamos as they did a great job in building a makeshift town), Very Good Costumes (The costume work for Oppenheimer is iconic and will be a big part of pop culture for years to come), Plot Structure was very unique and non-linear as Nolan takes a page out of Memento to use a non-linear structure to tell the narrative (and I am a big fan of this as it helps show the effects the Manhattan project has on the future and implications it has on the scientific and American community), Pacing was incredibly fast as the movie flies by its long runtime to fit in as much story as it can (this is neither really a positive nor a negative as there is nothing that could be cut from the movie), Climax was incredible as the movie really culminates to this moment (and this is done very well given how the movie jumps between time periods to help the audience holistically know the bigger picture), Tone was a culmination of a war bio-pic/courtroom-drama/grand epic as Nolan uses his signature style to take the best elements of all three to help establish a very unique tone, Saw in IMAX 70 MM and it really is an experience in itself.",9,Oppenheimer
"Greetings from Lithuania.If one thing i could be grateful to ""Oppenheimer"" (2023) is that it reminded me of ""Amadeus"" (1984). The rivalry between Salieri & Mozart, or to be more precise, Salieri's hate towards Mozart and the fact that he wasn't the genius motivated his revenge and hate, and that is presisely what happens in ""Oppenheimer"" - and i will leave it at that.On the other hand, Christopher Nolans new magnum opus ""Oppenheimer"" was master class movie on its own. While the story itself is a true one, unfortunately it did not captured my attention very much because I'm living on the other part of the world and some events that happens in third act of the film didn't really left me interested in them. What did kept me involved was brilliant filmmaking by Mr. Nolan. ""Oppenheimer"" is a real cinema for movie lovers - not especially a Friday night movie theater crowd - this was not a crowd-pleaser by any means. With cast as amazing as in here, i was been glued to me screen because of amazing performers, amazing directing, music, sound effects and cinematography. Script was great and more unique then i could imagine. And i have no doubts that Robert Downey Jr. Will get his Oscar nomination for this film - he stole every scene he was in - this is his take on Salieri.And Cillian Murphy was as good as he ever was.Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" felt like a unique movie theater experience, because i will probably never going to see film like this on a big screen soon again. Its ""artsy"", not a mainstream Friday night film and because of that it will leave many scratching their heads. But for those willing to take a chance, this is a biopic like no other.",10,Oppenheimer
"It's not often I say that. Joker, American History X, and now Oppenheimer are 3 phenomenal movies that I'll never watch again.Why?Oppenheimer was a fantastic portrayal of Robert J. Oppenheimers life pre, during and post Manhattan Project.The atomic bomb scene was an absolute cinematic masterpiece, and one of the best film moments of recent years (or decades)
The movie is an incredibly heavy 3 hour biopic that never slows down. It's a heavy watch, but the payoff is phenomenal.Cillian Murphy puts on his best cinematic performance yet, and Christopher Nolan takes us through his story in an expertly crafted movie.It's as close as I can get to being a perfect movie, but one that I'll likely never revisit.If you haven't seen it, go while it's in Theatres.",10,Oppenheimer
"Filmmaker Paul Schreder has called ""Oppenheimer"" the ""best, most important film of this century"". Hyperbole aside, we're only twenty-two plus years into the century, and not many of us will be around to confirm his hypothesis. So best? Well, that's very subjective. Important though, he might be onto something. Important in the way the latter part of the picture emphasizes Robert J. Oppenheimer's (Cillian Murphy) personal angst in leading a team that developed the capability of destroying the entire world and all of mankind. That could have occurred on July 16, 1945 with the testing of the first atomic bomb at Los Alamos, even Oppenheimer wasn't fully convinced of Edward Teller's (Benny Safdie) 'near zero' proclamation that all would be well.I must confess, I don't know a whole lot about the development of the A-Bomb, but the movie has steered me in the direction of learning more. What I didn't expect in the latter third of the film was how the railroad job the Gray Board, influenced by Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.), tried to demonize Oppenheimer for his early Communist sympathies, while questioning his loyalty to the United States. With eighteen years gone by and Oppenheimer's loyalty capably demonstrated, his treatment at the board smacked of personal animus for which Strauss eventually paid a price with his failure to be approved for a Cabinet position. That little tidbit about a future President casting a negative vote was a great bit of trivia I'll be anxious to research.Questions of best or most important movie aside, I think this is a valuable film for anyone to view keeping a historical perspective and how it translates to the modern era. With the threat of nuclear annihilation ever present, it's important for cooler heads to prevail on the world stage to prevent the kind of catastrophe that would emerge from the quixotic impulse of some madman. See the film.",9,Oppenheimer
"History is hardly ever as straightforward and simple as we something believe it to be. The same goes for people like J. Robert Oppenheimer. In learning about World War II and the development of the atomic bomb, the thing I remembered the most was that he was a brilliant man who was suspected of being a communist, thereby tarnishing his legacy. That however seems to be somewhat of the straightforward simple history we tend to like.Yet if this movie is as accurate as is claimed, a theorist (not just a theoretical physicist) might have an intellectual interest in leftist (specifically communist) ideas while, simultaneously, never fully committing. This was a theme touched on throughout the movie in which Oppenheimer was, in several instances, content to stick with theory.When the Trinity test then took place and he saw what came from theory being put into practice, I do believe that fundamentally changed him. Wrestling with the unleashing of such power and knowing he led the scientists responsible for it, should really change anyone with a conscience.What this picture does really well is show Oppenheimer neither as a saint who might have saved millions of lives at the cost of hundreds of thousands, nor as a sinner caught up in communism as might have been the case during the era of Joseph McCarthy and the Cold War. Rather, he was a man as brilliant as he was defiant, ordered as he was rogue, disciplines as he was cavalier. I believe Nolan, as the primary screenwriter and obviously director, respects us as the audience enough to leave it up to us to draw our own conclusions.",10,Oppenheimer
"This three-plus hour biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is a film about faces. They talk, a lot. They listen. They react to good and bad news. And sometimes they get lost in their own heads - none more so than the title character, the supervisor of the nuclear weapons team at Los Alamos whose apocalyptic contribution to science earned him the nickname; The American Prometheus.Cillian Murphy, staring with icy blue eyes, dominates the film, playing Robert Oppenheimer with a restraint that perfectly suits this charismatic yet chilly character. The story takes us from his student days in Europe, to his time as a professor in California in the 1930s and then to the Manhattan Project, the top-secret US programme to build nuclear weapons in Los Alamos, New Mexico, where his team races to create a bomb to end World War II. Murphy keeps us with him even when the character seems a bit opaque.The film is framed as a head-to-head battle between Oppenheimer and his nemesis, Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr), former head of the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). Throughout, Nolan's screenplay goes back and forth between two US government hearings in the 1950s which play like tense courtroom dramas, flashing back in long stretches to tell the story of Oppenheimer's life.Early on, there's a flash forward to the 1954 hearing of the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission that ultimately resulted in Oppenheimer, accused (among other things) of having hidden Communist ties, being stripped of his security clearance. This was the government's way of silencing him, since in the postwar world he'd become something of a dove on the issue of nuclear weapons. The hearing was the darkest chapter of Oppenheimer's life and using it as a framing device feels, at first, like a very standard thing to do.The film speaks quite often of one of the principles of quantum physics, which holds that observing quantum phenomena by a detector or an instrument can change the results of this experiment. The editing illustrates it by constantly re-framing our perception of an event to change its meaning and the script does it by adding new information that undermines, contradicts or expands our sense of why a character did something, or whether they even knew why they did it.How Nolan captures these sequences - the quiet before the sound of the explosion; the disquieting, thunderous, flag-waving applause that greets Oppenheimer after - are masterful, unforgettable fusions of sound and image, horror and awe. Christopher Nolan's complex, vivid portrait of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the ""father of the atomic bomb,"" is a brilliant achievement in formal and conceptual terms.The film's furiously entropic tendencies complement the theoretical discussions of the how's and why's of the individual and collective personality. To greater and lesser degrees, all of the characters are appearing before a tribunal and bring called to account for their contradictions, hypocrisies and sins. The tribunal is out there in the dark. We've been given the information but not told what to decide, which is as it should be. As Nolan reminds you, the world quickly moved on from the horrors of the war to embrace the bomb. Now we, too, have become death, the destroyers of worlds.",6,Oppenheimer
"There are a few other reviews here echoing the same sentiments. I asked the people sitting next to me what they thought and they were disappointed. I can't help feel the same. I have a strong background in nuclear physics. It was intriguing, but it was cut so jarringly that it was hard to keep up what was going on.Then finally, we have the big event that everyone was selling this movie on, and it was quite underwhelming. The characters don't do enough to catch my feelings. The only standouts for me were Robert Downey Jr and Emily Blunt, but RDJ's whole character arc was that he was insecure and just wanted petty revenge??The whole last hour I was checking the time hoping it would end, because I was just bored.",5,Oppenheimer
"It Just Didn't Live up to the Hype, it's Not Good Enough.Quick Sidenote 1 - Who Else Noticed Cillain Murphys' Face in the Underground Place, when he Looked at that Guy and Cillain Murphys' Cheekbones and Crazed EYES Were Disturbing as Hell? Was Cillian Murphy Really the Grim Reaper? 💀Quick Sidenote 2 - Apart from People who Love Movies Shot on Film and the ""Nolan can't do a Thing Wrong and even when he does we won't acknowledge it Crowd"". General Audiences won't Get into this Film (From my Observation of Todays IMAX Viewing), it's not that the General Audiences are Dumb (Some are though). It's Christopher Nolan and his (Lately anyway) inability to Convey the Plotline with as Least Noise (Confusion not actual Sound) as Possible.Here's how to Immensely Improve the Film -1. It's Too Long and Convoluted, Roughly Around When Matt Damon Meets Oppenheimer, That's when they should Of Started the Film, 10-15 Minutes of Backstory and then Matt Damon Meets Oppenheimer, That's the Correct Decision For the Film.2. Stop Constantly Cutting Back and Forth to Different Timelines, you can do it but not Constantly. It Breaks Immersion.3. The Sub-Plotline between Florence Pugh and Cillian Murphy was Pointless (For what I would have done within the Story). Get rid of it.4. The Family Drama Between Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt was more Snore and More Bore. Get rid of it.5. The Film is Over Scored (Although the Score is Magnificent), because of this, the Score is Less and Less Effective as Time Goes on. Dial it Back on Score.6. Focus more on the Team Building the Atom Bomb, with them going back and forth with eachother, internal struggles about the project, uncertainty about the project etc.7. This Particular Film is Too Long for the Material Presented. Cut 30 to 40 Minutes out of the Film.8. The Atomic Explosion, yh not Good Enough. When a Large part of your Marketing is seeing an Atom Bomb going Off in IMAX, you better Deliver. It half Delivered. It needed that Gigantic Mushroom Cloud and an Astonishing Shot. Sigh 😔, there's no Astonishing Shot. The Sound After was Good Though.9. Instead of that Political Court Drama, The Film should of ended like this. After the Trinity Test, the Film needed to Ratchet-Up things Further by Dropping Fatman and Little Boy on Japan and to see 2 More Gigantic Mushroom Clouds in IMAX Ratio with Different Shots, Both Aerial and Ground Shots.Build Up to that, not a damn court room Drama, get that Tension going and Oppenheimer Massively unsure about what is about to happen And Finally End it with a Portrait Shot of Cillian Murphy (Whilst the Spectacular Score Booms) in Dismay about what he had Created. I don't want to hear about it on a Radio 📻😔.This Actual Film -1. The IMAX aspect Ratio Cinematography was Ok, some Beautiful Shots.2. The Performances Across the Board Were Strong.3. The Score is Spectacular but there's too much Score which Detracts from its effectiveness as time goes on.4. The Scenes between the Team of Scientists Going back and Forth with eachother over theory and Predictions were Great to See.5. The Tension and Build up Towards and During the Trinity Test were Really Strong.If I could Phrase the Oppenheimer film in one Phrase, it would be -""It did well enough here and it did well enough there but that's not Good Enough""",8,Oppenheimer
"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype.",10,Oppenheimer
"I enjoyed this film very much. The actors were very well chosen. The three hours passed quite quickly which is a sign to me that a movie is successfully engaging.I kept hearing on the ads that you should see it in IMAX. As a musician, I don't need that ""score"" blasting at me for three hours. There were relatively few special effects sounds which required the IMAX system. The music score was one of those which just keep repeating and driving itself into your brain. (I would have loved to have seen this film with a score by John Williams, Danny Elfman or Michael Giacchino)Despite that I highly recommend Oppenheimer.",10,Oppenheimer
"It's gratifying to know that in a supposedly ""dumbed down"" America, a three-hour docudrama about a theoretical physicist and his atomic ""project,"" along with a closed-door security clearance hearing and an open Senate confirmation hearing, both full of dialogue and minimal ""action,"" is generating a huge, but deservedly so, box office. I found this film mesmerizing as the three hours seem to fly by for me. It has a very intelligent script, some masterful acting, and a focus on a fascinating, if enigmatic, character, i.e., Oppenheimer. The ""father"" of the atomic bomb was, indeed, a genius and generous-minded (on occasion), but also exhibited character flaws, and for such an adept administrator was also politically naïve.The physicists behind the letter to FDR knew Germany had a head start in nuclear power (Germany under Otto Hahn was the first nation to split the atom), and it would have been a dangerous world indeed if Hitler had a monopoly on the atomic bomb, but those same physicists were reluctant to use it against Japan in the waning days of the Pacific War, and Oppenheimer shared some of their reservations. The subsequent guilt he felt was manifest in a great scene in the film where he meets with Truman and says he has blood on his hands. Truman barks to him: ""no you don't; you built it but I authorized its use."" Later in the film, where he's being humiliated at the security clearance hearing, his psychologically astute wife asks him why is he putting up with this in person....""you must need this humiliation as penance for your guilt.""Kudos to Nolan for not, at least explicitly, tying the use of the two bombs to Japan's surrender. In fact, except for one high level meeting where potential targets are discussed, there's almost zero real-time reference to Hiroshima, Nagasaki, or the battleship Missouri. It's almost folklore in U. S. history, but not elsewhere, that the two bombs were solely crucial in bringing about a surrender from a fanatical enemy, but although most of us Americans don't want to believe this, Soviet entry into the war against Japan (at our behest; see Yalta) was probably more crucial. The 5-year Soviet-Japan Neutrality Pact offered some hope to Japan's War Cabinet that a negotiated settlement could moderately soften the blow of unconditional surrender. When the Soviet Union invaded Manchuria that hope was irretrievably gone and the Japanese leadership was shocked. There are more references to Soviet entry into the war in the minutes of the War Cabinet than the the atomic bombs which were indeed appalling to the leadership. The Soviets invaded the Kuril Islands and had plans, if the war continued, of invading Japan's large northern island of Hokkaido. The War Cabinet wanted no parts of a Soviet, even if shared, occupation of any of the home islands.Another historical issue is prompted by the film, and that is the veiled depiction that the physicists who were Jewish seemed more interested (if necessary) in using the bomb against Nazi Germany (who could blame them as emigres) but very reluctant to use it against Japan in the closing days. There's one pre-war scene where Oppenheimer meets Heisenberg in Germany, and as depicted, it's a fairly amiable meeting. Heisenberg's WW II impact is interesting. He apparently led the German nuclear effort which was subsequently found to be not very far along. Why, with the head start they had? Some explanations: (1) Speer did not allocate sufficient financial resources, (2) a negative opinion on Heisenberg is that he tried hard but made lots of mistakes, (3) a positive opinion on Heisenberg is that he purposely sabotaged the Nazi effort, and (4) theoretical physics in Nazi Germany was referred to as Jewish physics.",10,Oppenheimer
"Christopher Nolan is a savant of filmmaking. Cillian Murphy SHINES in this movie. They are one absolutely amazing duo. Not to mention a strong supporting cast around them and.""Oppenheimer"" is jam packed with information and begging to be watched 2, 3, 4 times. I walked out of the theater ready to watch it again already. It is fascinating and engages you the entire time you're watching.All of the performances by everyone involved bring the story to life to its fullest potential. They showed up and absolutely showed out on screen for this historical retelling: honestly a masterpiece. 1000% worth watching in theaters if you can.",10,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer is a rare biopic which, in spite of being driven entirely by dialogue and character drama, never bored me at any point. I was so amazed by the film that even after many a times not understanding the scientific stuff and all, I was glued to the screen, understanding it through the characters and their actions alone. I loved every bit of it and was totally focused. Once it was over, I walked out with a sense of satisfaction.Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan's masterpiece which he has painted with the help of talented actors such as Cillian Murphy who has sunken his teeth into the portrayal of the protagonist. He dominates every scene he is in, and I'm hoping he definitely gets an Oscar nod next year. If not him, then at least Robert Downey Jr. Deserves one for sure. His electrifying performance is so good you won't even think about seeing an old Tony Stark at all. Similarly terrific are Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Florence Pugh who leave the desired impact.The first half focuses on the character more than the main explosion which is later showcased in one of the most ingenious and cinematically remarkable ways. That means I should also warn you to not come merely for the explosion. This is a heavy dialogue-driven drama with little bit of action and almost no violence. A thriller feel is maintained throughout with the help of the background score, and that makes many scenes more intriguing to watch. I personally felt the human drama of Oppenheimer was more appealing than the explosion itself, because that is what this film is actually about: his life before and after the nuclear test. The film also excels in the technical departments; the sound editing is truly remarkable, and will make you hold your breath multiple times.I must say Oppenheimer turned out to be even better than what I had imagined. It was nowhere boring to be fair, and that's rare for a movie which is so long and driven entirely by conversations. Those who blindly follow the hype and go for fun are bound to be disappointed because this biographical & political courtroom drama has neither the set pieces nor the sci-fi of Nolan's previous movies. It is the kind of film which gets better with subsequent viewings. I'm just glad it made me return to the big screen after months and delivered what I paid for. The only sad part is, there's no IMAX near me, otherwise I'd have gone a second time too.",8,Oppenheimer
"Clear your shelves, Christopher Nolan and many of those involved in the making of his new movie OPPENHEIMER, you're going to need the space for the many, many trophies you are going to receive next spring.Based on the life of the ""Father of the Atomic Bomb"", J. Robert Oppenheimer, Nolan's latest epic is a rarity in today's Motion Picture landscape - a prestige picture, bankrolled lavishly, filmed gorgeously and populated with a veritable who's who of ""A"" list actors that tells a complex story of a complicated man who ends up remorseful of what he has unleashed in this world.And it works very, very well.Nolan regular, Cillian Murphy, is equal parts quirky, driven, determined and haunted in his multi-layered performance as the titular character - who is in almost every scene of this 3 hour film. He is fascinating to watch and his ""more internal than external"" performance draws the audience in throughout the events depicted in this film. It is the Best Performance of the career of one of the most interesting actors of this generation and one should not be surprised if his name is called during awards season next year.Murphy is capably supported by a long list of strong performers giving strong performances in roles that are much smaller than ones they normally receive. Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett(!), Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Matthew Modine, Kenneth Branagh (of course, it's a Nolan film), Jason Clarke and Alden Ehrenreich bring their ""A"" game to roles that could have been thrown away.Also, good ol' Tom Conti (one of the most interesting actors from the late '70's and early '80's) shows up in this film as Albert Einstein and reminds us all why he is such a good performer...and...wait until you see who shows up for one scene in this film as President Harry S. Truman!Oh...and don't forget Emily Blunt (as Oppenheimer's wife) and (surprisingly) Robert Downey, Jr. (as a politician using Oppenheimer for his own purposes). Both of them put in Award-winning-level uspporting performances, elevating two ""A"" list actors to the ""A+ list"".But this film is more than just it's performers. Nolan demands - and receives - top notch work from the Cinematographer, the Sound Designer, the Editor, the Costume Designer and the Composer (Ludwig Goranssson, NOT Nolan regular Hans Zimmer). They (along with Nolan) craft a beautifully made and put together film that will dazzle the senses. If you get a chance, see this film in a movie theater and, if you can, see it in either iMAX or 70mm, you will be glad you did.What holds this film back - just a little bit - is the story that is being told. Nolan (as he is want to do) plays with time and pretty frenetically cuts back and forth between about 4 different timelines to tell this story. It's effective most of the time, but at other times, it becomes distracting and....with a 3 hour run time...does drag a bit at times.But these are quibbles to a film that is ""as good as it gets"" by the BEST DIRECTOR plying his trade today. It is another triumph for Nolan and he will be making many, many acceptance speeches in just a few short months.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",9,Oppenheimer
"This movie is an experience. The direction, cinematography and music will take you away. The performances from all the main actors are Oscar worthy. This movie will defy your expectations. Cillian Murphy is definitely Oscar's number 1 contender.Now I understand that this may not be every person's cup of tea. Some people are seriously going to this movie expecting to have a "" fun"" time. Tho movie speaks about ""probably"" the world's biggest catastrophe EVER. Some conversations are very heavy to bear but this is the world we live in and the choices humans and governments make every day.Can't wait to see Barbie next.",10,Oppenheimer
"The story is presented really well and through the eyes of Oppenheimer. 90% of the movie feels like a flashback scene which though looks really cool, doesn't actually feel like something I would watch again. As in classic Nolan style 3 timelines are running simultaneously - before the atom bomb dropped, after and the present. I feel like this could have been handled better especially in the second half of the movie. The two main events in the movies the bomb explosion and the last act felt underwhelming. Actually the bomb explosion scene for which everyone was waiting so intently for was underwhelming beyond belief - Nolan should have used CGI 100%, it looked like an explosion from the 90s. There were so many characters and sub-stories that it felt like someone compressed an entire tv series into a 3 hour long movie.Movie critics will give this a good score owing to its incredible style and presentation and most of the audience will do the same. But purely from an entertainment point of view this was 7/10.",7,Oppenheimer
"I expected a thrilling story about building THE bomb. Almost NONE of that. What the what?This is firstmost a political witchhunt story, the likes of which we can see everyday now on CNN. And it honestly is incredibly boring having to watch these ENDLESS commisions and administrative interviews of people wanting to know if they are patriotic enough or not and if they have had ""contact"" with the Russians.BAD nr 1: NO REAL THRILL or DRAMA.I mean, I was really expecting some thrilling story about building and dropping this atomic bomb, but it was 90% nothing but nonstop commision TALK and political TALK and boring science TALK and some husband and wife TALK. NO thrill at all in that! Only a tiny bit of drama at the end.THE BAD nr 2: TOO LONG, WAY TOO LONG3 blipping hours long! If you would walk in 45 minutes late into the theatre, you would NOT have missed any thing. I am dead serious. Finally after 45 minutes they actually start building this bomb, the only actual excting part of this entire movie. Then they start TALKING in commisions about politics again! (Deep sigh).THE BAD nr 3: TOO MANY CHARACTERS, TOO MANY STORYLINESThere are WAY to many characters and these MANY actors dont even excell. Even Robert Downey, who does have a prominent leading role, is not impressing me. He OVERacts. And he looks kinda silly with his impression of an old (balding) man. It just doesnt look believable. And take Matt Damon for instance, trying to act like a tough military boffin with his fake mustache. I had to giggle everytime I saw him. And a lot of other actors, simply were miscast as well.It wants to be a personal portrait of Oppenheimer, THAT seems obvious, the blipping movie is named after him. But there is an INCREDIBLY longwinding political storyline as well. AND a husband and wife storyline. AND a science storyline as well. AND a mighty moral storyline which has to (supposedly) bring all these storylines together, but simply doesnt.Not any good? The ONE redeeming feature of this movie is the acting performance by Cillian Murphy. He is solid. Not Oscar worthy or anything, but solid. But only 1 out of SO many actors, being good, is not okay for me.My hopes were high. They were destroyed within the first 30 minutes. It never recovered.What a boring dud of a movie. Highly (artificially) overrated. Perhaps best suited for arthouse movie fans with a LOT of patience...?",5,Oppenheimer
"Patience growing thin! Dunkirk-Ok, Tenet-Really, Oppie-Oh Come on!.Fan of Nolan but seriously as a Non-American, it does not concern me. Where is the 'entertainment' element here??I am not bothered with what US of A did with their brilliance as it has never reflected herself to be a just country.All the actors did an outstanding job but after 3 hours if Russel Crowe asked me then no, I am not entertained!Don't care if its art or biopic or whatever.Also, the back and forth timeline is not appealing anymore.....its time to let time flow as usual now!I think Nolan takes a back seat for now while Guy Ritchie goes ahead!",10,Oppenheimer
"This isn't my type of film, I normally get bored or find the slow pace just loses my interest, my dad wanted to see this so I thought I'd go and give it a chance.It's a 3 hour film that actually flies by, it's so engrossing and engaging, the characters are so different and well portrayed, the cast is great, the twists and turns are surprising and you leave unsure of how to feel about so much of it.The one caveat is , like any historic movie, it's told from a perspective, there's No guarantee conversations or meeting went a certain way of it the content us accurate so I think stuff with the president for example could be taken a bit lightly.Overall it's brilliant, can't pick a fault, the lead was remarkable, I loved Matt Damon to. So much to praise, I literally can't find a fault.Even has Einstein.",10,Oppenheimer
"I want to thanks to Chritoper Nolan that make this film be perfect. I have just knew that Robert Oppenheim is a man which make the atom bomb. This story in this film also make me speechless because I was influenced not to leave a single sentence on the screen. The bomb explosion is also very realistic, maybe that's what differentiates Nolan compared to other directors who prefer to use CGI. This film also tells about complex matters regarding life decisions taken by Oppenheimer, I like Oppenheimer's life principles without mentioning other stories. Thanks to C. Nolan for this very beautiful film.",10,Oppenheimer
"Nolan strangely moves from petentious films, bad ones right away after you take the glitter away, to straight ahead masterworks of movie making. He seams to go 1 good 1 bad each time. Now it was time for a good one after the pretentious, sloppy Tenet. And boy did he deliver. This is a wonderful, challenging, unapologetic, very brave in some political way piece of movie making. Well acted all along, well written, large in scope but fully accomplishing. But it's what lies underneath what I love the most. I'm totally in love with the political subplots: younger generations need to be reminded not only about the dangers of the bomb, but for the equally killing Macarthysms. Call it how you want it, the blind, stupid far righters are a danger to the world.",10,Oppenheimer
"What an amazing movie, the visuals, sound, music, acting, directing, everything was 10/10, dont watch the film without knowing some history, its very philosophical type of movie, it makes you question about your actions, reflect on life, consequences, every minute of 3hr was amazing there was no boring scene, very good pacing, I understand its not meant for all audiences, yeah some scenes maybe could have been avoided but regardless the purpose of the movie was executed, definitely the type of movie that will be remembered for a long time. We can already expect it to leas best picture, actor, supporting actor, actress, sound, score, director, adapted screenplay and many more,",10,Oppenheimer
"It is fitting that a film about a person as consequential as Oppenheimer ended up being crafted by one of the most visionary directors of our time. Oppenheimer is a victory for filmmaking, a tour de force of incredible visuals, breathtaking cinematography and a sweeping scope that makes this narrative so illuminating. Every single aspect of this film blends into a seamless, awe inspiring experience where despite its gargantuan runtime, we are transfixed to a portrait of a man who's legend will forever be written in history. Brought alive by a phenomenon Cillian Murphy, Oppenheimer is the single greatest argument that movies and the theatrical experience still can mean something. If you watch this, definitely watch in 70mm IMAX - it's so worth it.Nolan has done what Hollywood desperately needed - make a coherent argument that filmmaking deserves a place in the pantheon of twenty first century art.",10,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer tracks one of the most important and terrifying events in the history of the world in epic fashion, creating a mature spectacle on a scale that's unheard of and feels like the culmination of all of Christopher Nolan's preoccupations whilst still breaking new ground. It's a sobering look at our impending doom.Cillian Murphy has been a long time Nolan collaborator but here he's finally given the spotlight and he's obviously amazing. He brings an incredible level of confidence to Oppenheimer that morphs into a constantly horrified and guilty presence in the later moments, able to express that fear and horror without any words.Robert Downey Jr. Is phenomenal here, it's the best he's been in ages. Strauss is a calm presence with his own agendas and a grudge to bear, a perfect way to go against type for Downey and a bold career choice following being in the biggest thing of all time (and Dolittle) that pays off magnificently.The rest of the cast is full of big names, most are only present for a handful of scenes but they all bring 100% to their roles and highlights include Benny Safdie with a superb accent and Emily Blunt who gets a standout scene when she goes toe to toe with Jason Clarke.Christopher Nolan's direction is perfect along with Hoyte Van Hoytema's breathtaking cinematography that reaffirms he's a master of the craft (especially IMAX). The film jumps back and forth between two stories, one in colour and the other in Black and White that makes the film feel like a smartly constructed puzzle that's easy to follow.Also, the much hyped Trinity test sequence is one of the most thrilling and awe inspiring moments of the year. Using a delayed reaction to get as much tension out of the build up as humanly possible and the fact that it was done practically just makes it even more mind blowing.Ludwig Göransson's score is another huge win. It manages to be so many things at once without breaking. Both modern and old fashioned, sweeping and triumphant yet also unnerving. It ratchets up the tension beautifully and confirms he's a perfect fit for Nolan's films.",10,Oppenheimer
"A very neat biopic for a life story as complex as Robert Oppenheimer's. With his original back and forth filmmaking style, though I still like Interstellar better, I think this is Christopher Nolan's best work to date.The casting is great. Even for a short screen time, important characters showed up played by huge star such as Casey Affleck and Gary Oldman. The scoring is good enough even though I still think Hans Zimmer is one of major keys Nolan's movies are as good as they are (Batman, Inception, Interstellar, etc.). The ending is very powerful just like what Nolan did with The Dark Knight, Inception and Interstellar. It is the highlight of the movie for me.",10,Oppenheimer
"I can't express enough how absolutely phenomenal this movie is. It will stand the test of time and will possibly go down in history as one of the greatest films ever made.The movie is three hours long and at no point does it lose your attention. Cillian Murphy should, and probably will, get nominated for an Oscar. And he probably will get it. I don't want to spoil anything, but from the practical visual effects, to every single performance, every aspect of this movie is inspiring. I saw it the weekend it came out and will be buying the blu-ray as soon as it is released.I would also like to add that Robert Downey Jr. Should also be nominated for an Oscar because he absolutely nailed his performance in every way possible. I highly recommend seeing this on the big screen. I assure you, you won't be disappointed. Me, my wife, and my 19 year old son were all completely blown away.",6,Oppenheimer
"I deliberately didn't want to read anything about it before the movie. 90% of the action takes place in a smoky office, which is quite boring. The film is unnecessarily long. It lacks dynamics, action, fantasy,science, mystery.... It seems that in America communism is still a mystical and taboo topic. Interesting for Americans and a little less for us others. The film has probably 300 characters and it is very difficult to keep track of all their names. Albert Einstein seems like a comical character and cannot be taken seriously. I can't say that the film doesn't carry a message but I expected much more from Nolan.",4,Oppenheimer
"I'm a huge Nolan fan since his first film. My favorite is still Memento, which is thorough and slow and very dialogue heavy as well as philosophical. I have a friend who works in Los Alamos as a chemical engineer and have visited the area as well as heard plenty about Oppenheimer and the way he changed the world. The importance of scientists and especially theoretical physicists is not lost on me. Between all that and my love for Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt, I'd been looking forward to this movie for a long time.That said, my entire group was disappointed with this movie, starting with the run time. I ask you, how is it possible that a three hour movie can feel rushed?! Somehow Nolan managed it. The first hour of the film feels so fast, disjointed and erratic that it gives you anxiety. He breezes over the most important parts of Oppenheimer's life and elaborates more on scenes that never happened (such as the ones with Einstein). The movie should be about a great man with conflicting emotions and instead we get political tripe with entirely fictional material. The real Oppenheimer had such an interesting life and personality that there was no need to embellish or insert so much random nudity, politics and Matt Damon. I'm still wondering what Nolan's point was in making this film. Why not just make a documentary if you're going to make such a boring lackluster story? There's just nothing here to pull you in and we really paid close attention. Eric Weinstein should have been consulted so we could have had a better movie discussing the plight of actual scientists in this country and how they are treated by our government. Tell the story of how secrets are kept from the scientific community to protect governments rather than citizens in order to slow progress and divert attention elsewhere. Whatever Nolan's point was, it was lost somewhere in the three hours of cameos and more anti Russian propaganda.",10,Oppenheimer
"My expectations are always high for a film made by Christopher Nolan who oversees the whole production whilst directing and writing it, he never lets me down and for this feature film, a biopic about the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a theoretical physicist who was pivotal in developing the first nuclear weapons as part of the Manhattan Project, and thereby ushering in the Atomic Age. What we get is a three hour biopic of Oppenheimer's life and in my opinion each minute and each scene is used to the fullest. My girlfriend thought it was too long though so I think it's a preference. You could say the black and white scenes which have a different perspective character entirely, to be unnecessary for the story told and that's fair, but in my opinion it's a perspective character which is needed. Stories can easily become biased but with a perspective character like Strauss makes us see how others see Robert Oppenheimer and it only helps the story Christopher Nolan is telling. Any fan of Christopher Nolan knows how he likes a non linear story, he does it here and It's done perfectly. Alternating between Oppenheimer's story from Cambridge to Los Alamos, his security hearing in 1954, and Strauss' confirmation hearing in 1959.Cillian Murphy stars as J. Robert Oppenheimer, with Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife Katherine ""Kitty"" Oppenheimer; Matt Damon as General Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project; and Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss, a senior member of the United States Atomic Energy Commission. The ensemble supporting cast includes Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman, Kenneth Branagh and Benny Safdie. The cast is full of phenomenal actors, each portraying a real figure. Nolan even got Matt Damon out of taking a break from acting, Damon's role in the film is far from the best I've seen but I'm certain he did a terrific job portraying General Groves. The best performance goes to Cillian Murphy, hands down. He has been in multiple of Christopher Nolan's films and lots of others, but never in a leading role like this. Peaky Blinders were always the best performance which I have seen of his, but that changed with his role of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Portraying a person who has existed and one with the reputation of Oppenheimer, makes it you either fail or succeed. I'm sure Cillian Murphy nailed each mannerism, you see it through his performance how he pays respect to the real figure, for example the weight loss. He should be nominated for best actor and as it looks like right now, win multiple awards for the performance, the best performance of his career or so is my opinion. Other performances which I really liked and found memorable, Robert Downey Jr and Matt Damon to name a few. Though brief, Tom Conti was terrific as Albert Einstein and I could easily see a biopic be made with him in the role.Christopher Nolan did it again, a film which is looking to be a huge box office success and he does it in a way which seems oddly new to Hollywood, Nolan never changed as it was Hollywood who did. I'm of course talking about the over-reliance of CGI and visual effects. The big explosion in the film which is as real as you can get without actually blowing up a real atomic bomb, he uses practical effects and creates a stunning looking film because of it. You get immersed and the thought of things being fake never crosses your mind, because it aren't. Of course there's CGI in the film but used sparingly like the shots in space. It's a visually striking movie which Nolan has made and the IMAX only makes it so much grander. Ludwig Göransson is yet again working with Christopher Nolan and I can say they're a brilliant duo. Nolan had advised him to use the violin for Oppenheimer's central theme in the film, with Göransson remarking that he had felt that it could go from ""the most romantic, beautiful tone in a split second to neurotic and heart wrenching, horror sounds"". This might be Ludwig's best musical score, it just might.Christopher Nolan began writing the script for Oppenheimer after he had finished Tenet, he had been envisioning the film for over 20 years before that. A primary theme of Oppenheimer is dealing with the consequences of Oppenheimer's actions, with Nolan opting to explore how consequences can affect people in a delayed manner as he felt people are not ""necessarily confronted with the strongest or worst elements of your action in the moment"". I just think it's a fantastic screenplay, it also worked very well with it being written in first person which was a first for the director. The writing is perfect, like so much else. If I should find something to criticize, I would say the writing for its female characters. But honestly, it's alright, I don't mind and my girlfriend didn't mind either. This is a film about Oppenheimer, we get to see the story through his eyes and his eyes only, except for Robert Downey Jr's character.Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times awarded Oppenheimer a perfect four out of four stars, describing it as ""magnificent"" and ""one of the best films of the 21st century"". Many critics share his opinion and honestly, I do too. Oppenheimer is on my top three films of Nolan's, The Dark Knight remains my favorite, but this is close to that. This might be one of the best films I've seen in the last year or two and I agree fully with ""one of the best films of the 21st century"".",10,Oppenheimer
"10 stars are not enough. This film is written stupendously well, the script is so intricate and complex it befits the mind of an uber genius like Oppenheimer explored by the genius of Nolan.There's nothing here I can add which hasn't already been said about the acting, the cinematography, the tools used to create ambience and mood, the music, the direction.Once in a while it is an absolute pleasure to go to the theatre, and watching Oppenheimer as IMAX experience made it so much more worth it.Congratulations Christopher Nolan and the entire massive team that helped and supported the making of this remarkable film. And thank you for it.",10,Oppenheimer
"Like Martin Scorsese and Alfred Hitchcock before him Christopher Nolan is one of the few directors who can guarantee a paying audience as surely as any of the big box-office draws in the acting profession. A film-maker of great skill he has nevertheless often eschewed 'seriousness' to work, if not necessarily in the 'popcorn' market, then certainly in the commercial field and that's where he has built up his following. But what will his followers think of ""Oppenheimer""? Will today's movie-going generation even know who J. Robert Oppenheimer was, (at the full-house screening I attended I saw two people leave), and can Nolan do justice to his subject?To that last question the answer is undoubtedly yes. As I say Nolan is a film-maker of great skill and ""Oppenheimer"" is unquestionably his best film to date. It's an old-school epic, three hours long, superbly shot on the biggest of canvases and with an all-star cast even if some of those Oscar-winning actors are reduced to cameos, (Gary Oldman as a devious Harry Truman). At its centre there's a terrific performance from Irish actor Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, chosen perhaps for his slight resemblance to the man but also because Nolan clearly saw in Murphy talents other of his screen roles never fully explored.Of course, in typical Nolan fashion the narrative isn't linear. The film may begin with Oppenheimer the Cambridge student and end with Oppenheimer the decorated old man but in-between Nolan skips back and forth in time, shooting both in colour and in black and white and framing his film around two sets of 'hearings', one in which Oppenheimer, late in his career, appears before a committee of three to see if his security clearance will be renewed, knowing that this is nothing more than a kangaroo court; the other, filmed in black and white, the much larger senate committee hearings set up to determine the suitability of Lewis Strauss to be U. S. Secretary of Commerce in Eisenhower's government and in this role Robert Downey Jr. Not only give the best performance of his career but should be a shoo-in for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. These scenes form the backbone of the film and may prove too talkative for Nolan's customary audience. That said, this is a beautifully composed and highly intelligent picture, clearly aimed at an adult audience. I wouldn't be at all surprised if it sweeps the boards at next year's Oscars.",10,Oppenheimer
"Even with 3 hours sleep and a stomach ache for most of the day I didn't yawn once I was absolutely captivated/enthralled more than I thought I would be. This better be up for at least 10 nominations! It's very impressive how Christopher Nolan wrote and directed such an in depth crafty art political brilliance filled ironic to my sleep amount of this long winded extravaganza that is well acted throughout. I have autism I crave quantum mechanics, I even understood the numerous studies science related. One of the best Christoper Nolan films of his career, my last name is Nolan too I wish I was related to him! The sound design throughout is exceptional I'm sure that'll even win an award. I'm glad despite feeling rough today I got to see Oppenheimer with my mom and sister Emily.",10,Oppenheimer
"Wow! This movie just knocked me out! So many parts of the movie were just excellent. I think I need a little time to fully process everything.. but I left the theater just in awe of the movie. Acting, script, cinematography, directing, score, sound, and visuals... were all just amazing.Nolan really knows how to make a really powerful film. It leaves you asking questions about war, and how the atomic bomb really changed things. I only had a few small issues with the film. It does sort of peak about 2/3 of the way through the film. At least in terms of actions of the film. Then it asks questions about what happens after you invent and use an atomic bomb. Really powerful stuff.. and it kept me interested the whole time.I loved seeing it in IMAX.. with the powerful sound especially. Although if you only get to see it in a regular theater.. that is ok too. But in a theater is the best way to see it for sure. Really awesome and it's such an inventive and powerful movie.",8,Oppenheimer
"Christopher Nolan, whose previous works use time and space as his playground, did it once again with this based on a true story film, something that we didn't expect. His way of storytelling proves that he's the greatest directors to ever live on the planet, mastering in building up the story all the while keeping the audience engaged by elevating its suspense, scope, atmosphere and music tempos, creating a masterpiece ouevre.Oppenheimer is a visceral experience. It is able to create and provoke tension and anxiety in their audience. Rarely do we ever get this type of films offering this kind of experience but Nolan did it, just like Interstellar or Inception. It is haunting. It is moving. It is evocative. It knows what it tries to deliver and it does so well in eliciting these emotions as you sit and witness through it all.Out of the 2 dozens of famous actors in this film, we have to give special shout outs to 4 of them namely Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. & Jason Clarke. Cillian Murphy is able to tell Oppenheimer's story largely from the looks and expressions of his face, a true work of art. His face just tells everything, like a grandeur painting that moves accordingly to the beat of the story and emotions. Emily Blunt as Mrs Oppenheimer is just impeccable. Her performance is so good, there was once scene that made us cried a bit. That 'it' scene that will appear on the screen as her name is called as one of the nominees for Best Supporting Actress and hell yes, we have high hope she will win next year's Academy Awards for this! Downey and Clarke are both impressive as well, 2 characters that are very good at spoken dialogues and they really did their homework to study the characters very well.We are truly in love with the dialogues. It is rich with contexts and it feels very densed. We just love the fact that the speed and pacing of the dialogues are almost similar to Aaron Sorkin's materials who directed The Social Network and Molly's Game. Dialogues are spoken incessantly, word after word, without putting a full stop for audience to breathe. And these dialogues really enrich and enhance the film's build-up, settings and mood that elevate the whole immersive experience.These dialogues, most of them, are necessary for the story and character developments. What are or have been said are the building blocks of both these elements, that by the end, they blossom themselves into something poetically but shatteringly beautiful; acknowledging of the broken humans living in a broken world, that these non-fiction characters are far from perfect, just like the rest of us.However, the dialogues may not be easily digestible for general audiences. If you're into science and history, you are at an advantage. If not, then these jargons and sometimes, poetic style dialogues would make your head spin. They are not friendly. Even when they did explain on quantum physics, it wasn't something that can be understood by everyone. We love the dialogues but to be safe, prepare a cup of coffee prior because this is one brain exercise film, the good kind, of course.If you're a Nolan fan, you'd know that plot twists are something he has in store for us. But did this biopic has one? Did Nolan take that risk? The risk that might jeopardize the authenticity of the story? Without revealing, we can say that the third act is very, very good. Something that most directors attempted but failed. However, Nolan did it naturally, the story unfolds excellently even with all the complexity that surrounds it. He did it smooth. Strong emotions were evoked, he left us something to ponder about. The experience was quite traumatic and he brought us along the journey to experience what it's like to be Oppenheimer. It is that good.This film is morally complex. It questions whether it's right or wrong. It questions whose side we are on. It delves deep and studies Mr. Oppenheimer and brings it along with us for the ride. Nolan was able to let us feel what he's feeling as if we're stepping in his shoes. Thought-provoking. Mind-wandering. Psychologists will have a great time in cinemas.A brilliant choice, Oppenheimer used both black-and-white and colour as it conveys different meanings with the former staying true to the real event that had happened in history with (mostly) exact dialogues, body language and circumstances powerfully acted mostly by Robert Downey and Alden Ehrenreich. The latter is used, to maximize its entertainment value while still maintains the actual events recorded in history. Not once we felt annoyed by the transition, it went well.Targeted for mass market, we felt this could have cut about 20-30 minutes short so that all audiences can enjoy. Although there was very little to none unnecessary scenes, we still strongly believe that Nolan could take out a few scenes. If this happened, the momentum and pacing would better for everyone. Also, the Trinity Test was purely excellent. The practical effects and sound designs were really executed well. The music score, composed by Ludwig Goransson, though not as masterpiece as Hans Zimmer, is breathtaking. It felt right with all the scenes, it elevates out immersive experience, it left us at the edge of our seats.Verdict: Hauntingly beautiful, Oppenheimer feels like a ticking time bomb as it evokes a strong visceral and immersive experience. Almost everything is done right, Christopher Nolan makes sure this film blows us away with a rich story, stark character studies, strong dialogues, powerful music score, impeccable acting amongst many others. While it is not Christopher Nolan's magnum opus, this is still one of his best ouevre in history.",10,Oppenheimer
"I had loved nolan since he did memento some of his films like interstellar and tenet were let down for me but this films brings him back in the game.The problem with both interstellar and tenet was the film was grand but i felt the human element was missing in this film the human element takes precedence in Oppenheimer
"" this is easily in his top three films ""the film is ambitious and it ticks all the boxes after watching i can't but draw comparison to the social network and believe me that's huge complement.Murphy did great job of portraying Oppenheimer he was nuanced and charismatic at the same time,robert downey jr. Was also great in this
i wont be surprised if rdj wins oscar for this.",10,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer isn't a biopic, it's a journey of questions through the eyes of one person, Nolan delivered an intellectual dilemma that leaves you thinking for a long time.The Acting is aces, everyone delivered a great performance, but yes Cillian is incredible and will get at least the Oscar nomination, Damon, Blunt are fantastic and RDJ is phenomenal, finally he gets to show his real talent in real movies!!!, a lot of cameos and boy I enjoyed everyone one, but Affleck and Malek will steal the show, Gary Oldman was superb too.The movie is long but you will not feel it, Nolan managed to tell the story in such a way you can enjoy it without losing focus or interest ( make sure to stay focused, everything you see at the beginning will be needed at the end ).Music is the key ""Actor"" in Nolan movies, same here, at some scenes that were just spectacular! Best of the year till now!The way Nolan shot the Trinity test was really smart, it wasn't about the blast itself but about humans, fantastic choice in my opinionThis is Cinema as I love, everything is about telling a story the best way possible, only a few directors can still do that nowadays. The end of the movie was just the beginning of another chapter and yes it leaves you asking a lot of questions!",7,Oppenheimer
"Great acting, score, cinematography. Script was a let down - some of the themes felt questionably heavy handed, leading to the end result quite confused in terms of message.Same applies to character work - even after 3 long hours, I still don't feel like I know or empathise with Oppenheimer any better than if I had just read his Wikipedia page.Don't even get me started on the female characters, who (in Christopher Nolan fashion) have little to zero character development: one of them is either naked or dead for 3/4 of her screen time.Overall, the movie seemed to sit on the fence for or just never expand on most of the philosophical and moral problems, so it ends up feeling 90% plot and 10% anything thematic, leaving me with the conclusion of 'Oppie was a complex dude'.7.5/10.",5,Oppenheimer
"Will some think this is boring? For sure. Will some think it's too long? Undoubtedly. But overall I thought this was a very quality film like most of Christopher Nolan's movies, and while this one isn't my favorite it's still good for what it is. It's a JFK-like historical drama. The acting/cast were all incredible and so was the set design, and also the lack of CGI and special effects. The directing and camera work were awesome too. The middle part with them detonating the test bomb was a very well-constructed and tense scene. It was also intelligent in a way to only show the American perspective of the war and how out of touch/indifferent they were with the suffering that they inflicted on the Japanese civilian population, except of course for the main character. He was portrayed very well and this movie is coming out at a very critical time in history, reminding us of the destructive potential of escalating to nuclear war with other countries (no matter the side) and that our responsibility with handling weaponized nuclear technology is not to be taken lightly, and we must have a moral conscience. The movie also showed the quick/immediate development of a post-war McCarthyist government which was portrayed how it should have been. This is good and informative 20th century history!",8,Oppenheimer
"This stands as one of the finest biography, drama film I've seen in recent years, truly a masterpiece crafted by Christopher Nolan.The screenplay is nothing short of remarkable, with clean and powerful lines effectively communicating even amidst numerous scientific terms.The cinematography is outstanding, leaving you feeling fortunate to have experienced it. Watching the film on IMAX is totally worth it.The cast delivered outstanding performances in this film. Cillian Murphy's performance, in particular, stands out as he portrays a complex and emotionally compelling role, capturing the moral dilemmas that Oppenheimer himself faced and those that resonate with us in today's age. His portrayal, facial and eye expressions add depth and authenticity to the character, making it truly impactful and thought-provoking. I won't be surprised if he wins 2024 Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading role.",10,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer (2023) is a movie that my wife and I saw in theaters tonight. The storyline follows a Princeton professor who is teaching a theory on a radical new science during World War II. The Germans and Japan are winning the war, and the arms race to build the next great bomb could tip the outcome. The scientist is asked to help the United States military create a bomb that could end the war. He will need to deal with the ethical aspects before, during and after the creation of the ask, as well as manage his personal life and political pressures.This movie is directed by Christopher Nolan (Tenet) and stars Cillian Murphy (28 Days Later), Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada), Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting), Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man), Florence Pugh (Midsommar), Casey Affleck (Gone Baby Gone), Rami Malek (Bohemian Rhapsody) and Gary Oldman (True Romance).This period piece is masterfully put together in every way. The storyline has depth, worthwhile subplots and dynamic characters. The cast is brilliantly selected and deliver tremendous performances - Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr are amazing. The cinematography was top notch and the lone action sequence was well executed, though some scenes of the bombings in Japan would have kicked it up a notch. I adored the depiction of all the scientists from this era. The ending twists and turns I never saw coming. This is worth every minute.Overall, this will be the best film of 2023 and is an absolute must see. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10,Oppenheimer
"This is one of the most intriguing and astounding movies I have had the pleasure of seeing in my over 60 years of movie going. Yes, there are some impressive special effects, but they are truly the least impressive things here.First is the script. A GREAT deal of history is condensed into three hours of often quickly delivered dialogue. It is succinct, and it is often brilliantly structured. Flashbacks, flashforwards, jump cuts, etc. Not to impress, as was too often the case in Dunkirk, but to create an ever richer tapestry of historical events and tie them together. Definitely deserves an Oscar.Second is the directing. Getting all of this to flow, and often rush forward in an intelligent and cohesive way was an act, or many acts, of directorial genius. Nolan was nominated for a Best Director Oscar for Dunkirk, but didn't win. This time he should definitely win. His work bringing all this together is phenominal.The acting is all fine to very fine. It should definitely make a star out of Cillian Murphy, whom I had never heard of before but who does a fine job as Oppenheimer. Damon is good as Groves, though I suspect some of his dialogue was ""enhanced"" to make the character more interesting. I read Groves' book on the Manhattan project. He didn't come off as that blunt and forceful.The editing is also remarkable. I was especially impressed with some of the sound choices at crucial moments, such as the explosion of the test bomb. It keeps you on your toes and makes you think because it delivers the unexpected.This movie is 3 hours long. I was not bored for a single minute.My hat is off to Nolan. This is truly a work of genius.",10,Oppenheimer
"Disgrace. I feel sorry for the paper that carried these pointless rows of dialogue and the hard drives packed with nonsensical scenes.Did Scorsese get drunk at a party and claimed you're no good director if you make a movie less than 3hours long and now everybody is trying to live up to it?This could've been a short film packed with ambivalence, tention and regret - but it's just a diluted piece of propaganda meandering the dark hallways of Hollywood. Cilian did a decent job, but the rest of the leading cast is just cringeworthy.Can't even grade it, it was unwatchable til the end, left the movies and stared at the ceiling, it was more fun.",10,Oppenheimer
"It's taken me a few days to be able to sit down and write down my thoughts about Christoper Nolan's newest big screen epic, the other part of the now infamous ""Barbenheimer"" double bill that has been re-writing record books over there launch weekends, having had this time to ponder and contemplate I am confident in saying that I've never seen a film quite like this biopic and while it's a film with flaws and components that don't stick their respective landings, Nolan's film is nevertheless a powerful, poignant and technically marvellous piece of original film-making that further establishes the esteemed director as a generational talent whose skill set is unrivalled.It's incredible to think that a three hour dialogue heavy expose of a theoretical physicist and the creation of the worlds first atomic bomb could become a film that is being viewed on such a scale that Oppenheimer is currently playing too and while it's clearly been enhanced by the fact Nolan's heavy hitting drama has been partnered alongside the pink behemoth that's Barbie, there's also no denying that audiences are hungry for original content that gives them something more than just another run of the mill experience and that's exactly what Oppenheimer does.Told in a typical Nolan like fashion that refuses to play out in a manner that could said to be stereotypical, Oppenheimer operates in multiple timelines and requires audiences to pay close attention to who is who but despite covering immense ground and delving into far more than just Oppenheimer's past, present and future or the bomb he was responsible for bringing into existence, Nolan's film never becomes too complicated or overbearing as clever direction, editing and script work ensures that its three hour runtime will grip anyone willing to go along with it, creating an utterly engaging and even white knuckle experience that is the very definition of what cinema is all about.Lead by a long overdue and awards worthy turn from Cillian Murphy as the titular figure, who is ably supported by a string of A-listers that most notably includes key performances from the likes of Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's long-suffering wife Kitty, Matt Damon as military head honcho Leslie Groves and Robert Downey Jr. In a scene stealing performance as Lewis Strauss, Oppenheimer is all class on screen as Nolan juggles one of the most stacked ensemble casts of the modern era and while some of his big name performers might only get mere minutes of screentime, each and every one of them brings their A-game to what must surely be regarded as Nolan's most noteworthy feature yet based on performances.Outside of this aspect of Nolan's masterwork is the technical elements of this big budget affair that includes an unforgettable score by Ludwig Göransson, exemplary editing by Jennifer Lame, beautiful cinematography from the increasingly impressive Hoyte Van Hoytema and sound mixing/editing from Nolan's team that ensures despite the fact Oppenheimer is very much focused in on the people at the heart of the story, so much of the film still feels like a grand cinematic offering and there are moments within Nolan's opus that are likely to remain some of the most memorable cinematic moments of recent times, none more so than the breathtaking detonation test scene that left my particular screening as silent as a field mouse.I have no doubt that like many of Nolan's films in the past decade detractors and naysayers will turn their attention to singling out elements of Nolan's film that may be considered weak points and while there's going to be further debate about the sound mix of this film and Nolan's films as a whole, that at times have their dialogue drowned out by the score or other aspects of the mix or the debate that rages about Nolan's ability to connect on the human level, that is on show here with a strangely cold romantic element between Murphy and Blunt and also with Florence Pugh's Jean Tatlock (not due to performances, more so development) but allowing your gaze to be directed into these areas as a main point of focus is robbing one of the experience they could otherwise have.Building to a crescendo that is both surprising, haunting and unforgettable, it's unlikely that you will soon forget Oppenheimer, a beautifully staged biopic that is also so many other things all at once, where Oppenheimer ranks amongst all of Nolan's work will take some time to decide but what's undeniable is the fact Nolan has once more proved original film-making is alive and well, should one take the time and care to bring it too life.Final Say -A film that feels unlike any before it, Oppenheimer is a big screen epic that is both grand and intimate, thrilling and confronting and a further addition to the growing legacy of Christoper Nolan to be regarded as one of the most important voices in cinematic history.5 bowls of marbles out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",9,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer is not solely based on the Trinity. It's entirely political drama. Just a reminder to the audience of how obsessed humans are with power and fame. Music is the true hero of Oppenheimer's film. Every highest point throughout the film causes enormous tension. Everyone did an excellent job. The visual grandeur of Trinity underwhelmed me, but the music helped to compensate. Nolan has once again demonstrated his ability to present a political drama. Where all of the mental state were handled flawlessly. Overall, a remarkable image and historical significance that should never be forgotten. The film will leave you speechless.",8,Oppenheimer
"As expected this is a fantastic movie. Oppenheimer contain some of the best acting ever seen and the directing is simply amazing. The music score is stunning, the story brilliantly told, and there are barely any flaws. This is intelligent filmmaking of the highest order and come Oscar season this will win all but a few of those statues.With that said I am still only giving this a 8/10 and I have two very good reasons for it.The first reason I think many will agree with me on and that is the length of the movie and the dragged out scenes, dragged out storytelling. This is one of the few rare cases were a studio executive should have put is fot down, but instead Nolan was likely given free range. The movie clocks in at 3 hours, and you do feel those hours because although this is one of most brilliant movies of our time, there is also almost nothing going on. There is talking, reading of paper, brief discussion about physics, more talking, reading more paper, another brief discussion. Only occasionally interrupted by a sex scene or a political discussion whether communism or fascism is the worst ideology. With the exception of the first atomic bomb explosion scene, which is beyond amazing, beyond brilliant, but except that scene what I mention above is the movie. That is it.Yes, the character study of Oppenheimer is in the center and as such this is one of the best ever made, but his career and life is portrait by reading of paper, a brief discussion about physics, more talking, reading more paper, another brief discussion. This is a movie you can watch one time for the novelty, twice for its brilliance, but after that never again because it will simply get boring.The second reason this movie is not perfect is the background- and side characters. Emily Blunt's acting is almost bad, or her character is badly written, perhaps both? And Florence Pugh? Seriously? The ""council"" gentlemen and the other students, and almost everyone not having a prominent role, are all so much worse than the main cast that it shows. Murphy, Matt and Robert are all fantastic and put in the performance of their lives and as long as the focus are on them, what they do, say etc. This might be the best movie ever made. But as soon as someone else come into the picture the quality immediately sink to almost mediocre level.With those negatives out of the way I need to mention the Atomic bomb explosion scene again. That scene is heart stopping, the entire movie theatre went so silent and the awe moment is absolute classic, stunning. Filmmaking at its best.A 8/10 and I highly recommend. If you can overlook the not so great actors, and you do not mind the dragged out runtime you are likely to think this is the best movie ever made. It is not, but it is the top contender of the year for sure. At least until The Marvels show up.",8,Oppenheimer
"This movie is one of the best movies of this year. I like C. Nolan. I also really liked this movie. The movie is told from Oppenheimer's point of view. I think it was fine. Some scientific topics were very difficult to understand for me. I think the bomb scene was good. I think the acting was very good. Cillian Murphy played the static, cold character very well. Robert Downey Jr. Played great too. I think tacting was generally so good. I think there were some boring scenes in the movie. There were scenes in the cinema where I started to sleep out of boredom. But overall, I think it deserves an ""8"" point. This movie is one of the best movies of this year. I like it. I also watched the other movie (pink movie) first. It was so good after that movie.",6,Oppenheimer
"The movie was different from what I expected. I thought there was be more focus on the Manhattan project and Oppenheimer's role and less on Oppenheimer's personal and political life. It turns out the movie is almost exclusively about Oppenheimer's personal and political life.The sound is okay but nothing special. For the most part it's just really loud.The most exciting part of the movie happens about 2 hours in and is followed by about 40 minutes of boredom. The movie comes alive in the last 20 minutes.Overall, the movie felt long and less exciting than expected. It was easy to get lost and miss things if you didn't pay attention for just a moment. This is one of the few movies where you need to read the Wikipedia article about the person before watching.",3,Oppenheimer
"First of all- they left out the science and the interesting problem solving when inventing the a-bomb.They focus on relationships, corrupt leaders, espionage and the communist paranoia. These subjects are covered in other movies - and seen several times before. I had hoped to watch something new.However, They partly succeeded covering Oppenheimers regrets and dilemmas creating the bomb.The epilogue- lasting about one hour - really doesn't make any sense and didn't add anything interesting to the story.The acting is however good, exception of ""Einstein"". The mix of sound, music and speech is sometimes disturbing- especially with bad sound quality at the cinema. This is the loudness war all over again.This movie is a disappointment and the available documentaries are far better.",10,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer is an awe-inspiring masterpiece that captivates from start to finish. Christopher Nolan's visionary direction and Cillian Murphy's stunning portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer bring history to life with an intense and emotionally charged performance. The film's cinematography is breathtaking, seamlessly transporting the audience to the World War II era. The intricate storytelling delves into the complexities of Oppenheimer's life, showcasing his brilliance as a scientist and the moral dilemmas he faced during the creation of the atomic bomb. Thought-provoking and intellectually stimulating, Oppenheimer challenges viewers to reflect on the consequences of scientific discoveries. The supporting cast's performances are outstanding, adding depth and nuance to this profound narrative. In all aspects, Oppenheimer is a triumph that leaves a lasting impact, reminding us of the power of cinema to enlighten and inspire.",9,Oppenheimer
"Synopsis: Oppenheimer handles a huge project of the creation of the atomic bomb that leads to all kinds of consequences on his personal life and many others surrounding him. This leads him to be the father of the atomic bomb and ""the destroyer of worlds"" as he becomes one of the most important figures in history.Directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Cillian Murphy as Robert Oppenheimer himself in a lead role for the first time in a Nolan film, after being in most of his films. Cillian Murphy looks nothing like the real Robert Oppenheimer physically. Yet, Murphy is able to portray the famous figure in a role that would lead him to win an academy award easily. From facial expressions to Cillian Murphy's wide eyes that are capable of speaking without him having to say a word and how they also can express guilt, regret, sadness, confusion, and all sorts of feelings that Oppenheimer went through while completing the complex project of the atomic bomb. As well as, the support of the make up and hair design department, audience members are able to capture Oppenheimer in three different stages of his life, young version, middle aged version, and an older version of the character. After his role in The TV Show Peaky Blinders (2013 - 2022) as Thomas Shelby, his popularity grew and everyone sees him as Shelby. However, after watching this film, audience members will easily forget that and a new image will be created in everyone's head as him being Robert J Oppenheimer.Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss gives such a heavy and top tier acting role that his presence can be heavily felt on screen and in the events and the different stages that his character goes through. It is by far the second best acting role in the film after Cillian Murphy's, it is for Sure Oscar worthy for Best Supporting actor. Same thing will Cillian's image among fans, RDJ has the image of Tony Stark/ironMan in everyone's head. Everyone has gotten used to seeing him as that superhero who flies and shoots lasers from his hands. But, that image can e easily forgotten after watching this film. I am not denying every great thing he did for the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man as I am a huge fan of it. But, this film reminds everyone of who RDJ really is as the actor who is able to portray and put on some great acting skills and Oscar worthy performance like he used to before as Harry Lockhart in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005), Charles Chaplin in Chaplin (1992), or Paul Avery in Zodiac (2007).On the other hand, Matt Damon as Leslie Groves is the only role that added nothing to the table compared to everyone else's appearance. Even though he has a huge screen time and he plays an important role in the story, some other actors have less screen time than him and they did a better job. Like Rami Malek and Edward Teller.Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer, Rami Malek as David Hill, and Alden Ehrenreich as Senate Aide throughout the whole film, do not have a scene that would put the spotlight on them and make them noticeable until we reach towards the end in which all of them will have their time, their moment, and their scene to shine which what made those scenes very special specifically because of their acting skills.In addition, there are so many other actors that appeared in the film (some are a surprise) in which they all have some great scenes and great acting skills that will lead them to shine in their scene and I will refuse to mention them to avoid any spoilers and it would rather be better if you walk into this movie not knowing that they will make an appearance.The film deals with sound effects in the most amazing way especially in moments of silence whenever the film focuses on Oppenheimer's point of view and what goes through his head in terms of fear, regret and confusion like heavy breathing, screams or countdowns.On the other hand, the film's sound mixing is horrible to the point that it may holdback a viewer's experience and understanding of the events of the film due to the struggle of hearing the dialogue. It's either their voice can hardly be heard, or the music at most times is louder than the speech. This is not a first time for a Nolan film as films like Tenet (2020) and The Dark Knight (2012) have a very similar issue in terms of hearing the speech.Not to mention that the Music score - that was louder than the speech at most times - is greatly composed by Ludwig Göransson who returns again with Nolan as he composed Tenet (2020) in which the similarities can be heard between both Tenet (2020) and Oppenheimer (2023). There is a specific tone and vibe that Ludwig Göransson used in both films to deliver the film in the way it should be. However, many have surprisingly compared Ludwig Göransson's work in Oppenheimer (2023) to Hans Zimmer's work in previous Nolan films like in Interstellar (2014) by specifically comparing Ludwig Göransson's music piece ""Can You Hear the Music"" in Oppenheimer to Hans' ""S. T. A. Y"" in Interstellar (2014). In my opinion, this is a totally unfair compression as Ludwig Göransson's work is nothing compared to Hans' work. That does not mean that Ludwig Göransson work is not that good but I just think that comparing what Hans Zimmer did lowers Hans' work quality as well as Ludwig Göransson's work.When promoting the film, it is suggested that seeing it in IMAX 70MM is A MUST which hyped everything as expectations has risen that audience members will probably experience something similar to Interstellar when it comes to the visuals and the cinematography. Yet, most of the film is literally being shot indoors with no room for visually stunning shots to even be introduced and present because the film depends on dialogues in the first place.But, does that mean that seeing in IMAX 70MM was NOT worth it? NO
Does that mean that I DON'T recommend everyone to go see it in IMAX 70MM (the format it is suppose to be seen in)? NO
Because, how often do film directors release films that are shot using IMAX cameras and are offered in IMAX 70MM (film IMAX and not digital IMAX)? It's probably once every 2-3 years. Therefore, I do highly recommend anyone to see it in IMAX 70MM FILM for the full experience and I promise it won't disappoint and the next time a film will be offered in IMAX 70MM will provably be in 2 or 3 years. But, I really was hoping and expecting an Interstellar or Avatar (2009), type of cinematography.The story of Robert J Oppenheimer isn't as complicated as how it is being introduced in this film. But, isn't the way that Nolan introduced and made this whole biography film different, unique and more complicated than other biography films, is what truly makes Nolan a unique film director?This is the first time that Nolan does a biography/based on a true story type of film and Im more than glad that HE did it, because I'm 100% positive that any other filmmaker would've turned it into an ordinary, usual and typical biography film without including any complications or mind blowing twists like Christopher Nolan.My rating is 9.5/10 (MIGHT CHANGE ON 2ND VIEWING)

"Oppenheimer review :""I am become death; the destroyer of the worlds""; this particular Bhagvad Gita reference finds itself in the most unlikely moment in Christopher Nolan's latest cinematic spectacle called Oppenheimer, which is the name of the father of the atomic bomb. Knowing the genius of Nolan, he tells the the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer in his now patented ""non-linear""form with the all important Sanskrit phrase from the revered Hindu holy book forming part of a sex scene as well as the adrenaline rushing ""test"" of the atom bomb.The film is not just a simple biopic on the creator of the atom bomb but also a wonderful insight in to the political situation of the '40s, particularly the World War II. Oppenheimer is shown to be leftist inclined; an ideology which gets him embroiled in a litigation later. His relationship with his fellow scientists (particularly the great Albert Einstein) as well as his personal affairs with his wife (Emily Blunt) and girlfriend (Florence Pugh) are effectively shown.Quite verbose in its presentation with two parallel conversations leading to the climax, Oppenheimer is certainly not everyone's cup of tea, particularly if you are craving for just action and not dialogue heavy stuff. The actual bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki isn't shown as Nolan prefers concentrating on aftermath of the same. Oppenheimer's meeting with then POTUS Truman makes for a highly interesting scene. So is the climactic revelation about a certain crucial character.Technically, Nolan scores full marks yet again with an outstanding background score, awesome visual appeal and top notch production values expected from him.The cast is extraordinary and expectedly, Cillian Murphy delivers his best performance till date. Robert Downey Jr. Is the scene stealer as Lewis Strauss, the Chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). Matt Damon is also a standout as General Groves, the director of Manhattan Project. Rami Malek leaves a mark even in a cameo. The rest of the cast is also first rate.Oppenheimer may not match the level of Nolan's Inception (2010) or Interstellar (2014) but is way above the ordinary Hollywood stuff being served these days. Don't miss it in theatres!!Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni.",10,Oppenheimer
"Nolan yet again proved that why he's one of the finest directors till date with 0 disappointing movies.. Oppenheimer is exceptional..! Brilliant at performance level..terrifying and horrifying tense music..highly convincing screenplay..terrific and beautiful visuals..dark and complex nature (not comparable toll to other Nolan classics)...
Literally Nolan itself - school of masterpiece arts ..
Oppenheimer is very great epic and non linear..It will sure shot very horrific movie not for every audience! If you are dying to watch pure drama portion oriented cinema, If you want to see some terrifying psychological brilliance and If you're fan of anyone who are involved in this film - Go For It!! Oppenheimer should remain forever until the drama school and making exist.",10,Oppenheimer
"""Oppenheimer"" by Christopher Nolan is a film that delves deep into the consequences of the atomic bomb, focusing on Oppenheimer's perspective. This film requires a genuine passion for physics or history to fully appreciate its subtleties and biographical content.The imagery of the various explosions, accompanied by carefully orchestrated music and sound effects, creates an intense visual and auditory experience. At times, they even evoke feelings of tension and stress, enhancing the viewer's immersion in the story.The performances by the actors are remarkable, especially Cillian Murphy's brilliant portrayal of Oppenheimer. His captivating and nuanced interpretation brings this complex character to life, while Matt Damon, in the role of General Groves, delivers a solid and convincing presence.The film skillfully explores different temporal tones, offering a non-linear narrative that adds an additional depth to the story. The smooth transitions between color and black-and-white sequences add an artistic and symbolic dimension to the overall experience. These aesthetic choices enhance the emotional impact of the narrative and clearly distinguish the different eras and events.It's worth noting that to fully appreciate this film, prior interest in the history of the atomic bomb, as well as Oppenheimer's life and work, is necessary. With a duration of three hours, the film may seem lengthy to those who are not invested in these specific subjects.The story is divided into three distinct parts, with the first two closely interconnected. The first part focuses on Oppenheimer's training as a physicist, highlighting his interactions with Heisenberg and other eminent scientists of the time. The second part centers around the creation of the atomic bomb, the tests conducted at Los Alamos, and the scientific challenges faced by the team. The final part of the film focuses on Oppenheimer's hearing, where certain high-ranking officials, envious of his accomplishments, attempt to discredit him by presenting him as a spy working for the Soviets.Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" is a film that delves deep into the history of the atomic bomb, offering remarkable performances, impressive visuals, and complex storytelling. It is an immersive cinematic experience that reveals the moral, scientific, and historical aspects of this pivotal event in our history.Special mention goes to the fantastic Gary Oldman, who is completely unrecognizable in the role of President Truman.",10,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer was a C-.Solid lighting, production design, and great cast. That's about it.It is yet another Christopher Nolan film with an overly-dramatic score to let the audience know how profound he is being. He also has never met an editor he likes. The film is way, way too long. A meandering plot and a last act that is spliced together like a 1980s MTV music video. Outside the lighting, which was good, the cinematography was poor with unimaginative framing and very little use of creative angles or motion. I think Nolan thinks that the IMAX format somehow automatically makes the cinematography special and artistic and he single-handily proves that notion wrong with this film (as well as Dunkirk).Nonetheless, it will find its way into a nomination/and or for Best Picture because of the emperor's new clothes.",10,Oppenheimer
"This film is a damn masterpiece. There are not enough words to propperly describe it and, at the same time, few sentences can truly explain how good this film is. And i can't say its flawless, but its ""flaws"" are so escarce and so minimum that the don't really matter.First thing I want to mention about this work of art is the acting performances. With a cast so stacked of stars, you would think some of them may not have the expected performances or even enough screen time (which I think is something that happened to Rami Malek, whose talent seemed a bit underappreciated): but it is the exact opposite. Everyone's performances are top tier, charismatic, powerful, memorable. It sounds too optimistic but they really are, but this is also due to the opportunities the film offers; it's almost three hours of intense, long, fast dialogues, in an exchange of politics, philosophy and physics terminology; and I have to be very honest here, this is not a story that can be missed even a bit. You may come after a brief bathroom break and find yourself lost in the plot. But it's all worth the attention. Its pace is perfect, and the three hours go by like nothing.Then we have, of course, the soundtrack and the photography, two aspects that are always perfectly taken care of in Nolan's films. So adecuate, so well prepared, you feel like every scene matters, you don't want to miss a single shot, a single sound.But what really surprised me and the thing I enjoyed the most is that the film talks about many other topics that are not shown in the trailer, so you come into it with an expectation and receive much more.With time, I'm sure it will be considered as a classic film, one of the best of 2020's decade, for shure.",10,Oppenheimer
"This movie is easily one of the best films this century yet despite that it gets called ""boring"" because it doesn't have action sequences in the film. It seems like most people seen this because of the whole barbenheimer trend and not for the story about Robert J Oppenheimer. Calling this the most boring movie ever is crazy. And calling it confusing is understandable but if you paid attention to what they were saying you would understand the timelines. It isn't the atomic bomb movie it's the movie about the physicist Oppenheimer. We need more films like this cause the same mcu bs is making everybody think mid movies are cinema nah this is cinema sorry not sorry.",6,Oppenheimer
For me this movies is the best movie in this decade and one of the best nolan movie ever seen and one of the best movies of the all time actually this movis is top 5 movie I ever seen cillian is the best and deserve oscar and oppenhimer deserve oscar for best picture and cinematography and music and moreRobert downey jr deserve oscar for best supporting actor and also matt damon is one of the best I only say this movie is masterpiece and nolan should win oscar for the best director in this year and he deserve and florence pugh deserves oscar for the best actress in this year I love this movie I won't see this movie againThank you for reading.,5,Oppenheimer
"I was excited to see this film, but ended up feeling really disappointed. The overall structure is a convoluted mess. Nolan jumps around in the timeline with his narrative style, which was suited for Interstellar or Inception, but just makes a mess of story in a biopic about the father of the atomic bomb.Firstly, Is it worth seeing? Yes, but there's no reason to rush to the theater and watch in on the big screen. It's mostly a dialogue-driven film, and the big ""boom"" scene isn't impressive. It looks like they just blew up a big stack of dynamite and filmed it. Obviously they couldn't blow up a real nuke just to make a movie, and maybe CGI didn't look good. Either way, the bomb test scene, when it finally gets there, despite seeing it in IMAX, with booming speakers, was underwhelming.Much of the film focuses on the personality of J. Robert Oppenheimer as a flawed person, neither martyr nor warmonger. Cillian Murphy's portrayal is fantastic. However, the plot focuses heavily on the McCarthy-era interrogation he faced where he lost his security clearance, and was subsequently removed from the Atomic Energy Commission. Of course we also see the development of the atomic bomb, and various snippets of Oppenheimer the ""fellow traveler"" (those who were sympathetic to communist and left wing causes but never joined the party), Oppenheimer the womanizer who cheats on his wife, Oppenheimer the clumsy student who isn't as smart as his peers, and finally Oppenheimer the charismatic leader and of some of the most brilliant minds in the world working on the atomic bomb.The follow up to this is all having to do with a more obscure figure in history, named Lewis Strauss, potrayed by Robert Downey, jr. This is where the plot gets lost. Without knowing all the details of Strauss's involvement ahead of time, the whole witch-hunt trial was confusing and convoluted. This part of the story dragged on forever.Now, regarding the historical accuracy, there are lot of famous figures represented in this movie. It's true that Oppenheimer knew all these people, and all these world-famous physicists who, during this strange time in history, were as world reknown as rock stars and entrepreneurs are today. However, they barely say much, they just appear to have a few words while they point Oppenheimer to different people.I also found it odd that Nolan decided to include Einstein, but no mention of how he too was considered a fellow traveler and had more communist affiliations than Oppenheimer, and was briefly subject to some red scare vitriol.I also really questioned the historical accuracy of the whole thing in a particular scene where Oppenheimer is having a tryst with a communist portrayed by Florence Pugh. They start talking about Marx's Capital, how she's read all three volumes. He says ""possession is theft"" and she corrects him ""property is theft"" as supposedly a famous quote from the book. MASSIVE FACEPALM moment.Anyone with a modicum of knowledge about leftist history or Marx, would know that ""Property is Theft"" is a famous slogan from Pierre Joseph-Proudhon, an anarchist who Karl Marx once was friends with, but who he heavily criticized and basically tore apart in subsequent essay. Ever since the collapse of the first international, anarchists and Marxists have not seen eye to eye. No Marxist, let alone a CPUSA member in the 1930's, would be misquoting Marx with Proudhon. This was either a glaring oversight, OR deliberate trolling on the part of Nolan. I'm not sure.Either way, it brings into question the accuracy and the underlying message of the rest of the film. Nolan has included a lot of counter-revolutionary themes in his Dark Knight trilogy, and even hinted at being a closet Tory, so I don't trust him to portray Oppeheimer's saga accurately. I found a lot of similar issues with Aaron Sorkin's dreadful Lucille Ball biopoc. The idea of both films seems to be to ""rescue"" the legacy of these iconic figures by exorcising their communist flirtations as naïve youthful indiscretions. All the while ignoring the reasons why communism was so en vogue in the first half of the 20th century.There are a lot of other issues that I could talk about how general Leslie Groves, portrayed by Matt Damon, was made to look like a an gruff but affable ally and good friend of Oppenheimer. By some accounts, they were much more at odds with each other, and some even suspected Groves of being a fascist (people sometimes forget, with all the focus on communist witch hunts, how many fascists and Nazis were in the US at the same time, even in positions of power of prominence). Of course Groves pushed through Oppenheimers security clearance, not because he liked him, or even trusted him, but because he knew that he was their only chance of developing the a-bomb and beggars couldn't afford to play purity politics.Wait til this movie hits streaming to see it, and definitely read some books. Don't take these biopics at face value as real history.",10,Oppenheimer
"This movie, about one of the most significant events in the history of humanity effectively boils the entire story down to a very drawn out HR meeting to decide whether J. Robert gets his security clearance revoked or not many years after the event.Er... who cares?I understand that Nolan chose to focus on the man rather than the event, but I think this was a mistake. Three hour biopics can work (rarely), but this is no Schindler's List. It is more a kitchen sink drama where the majority of the characters are one dimensional (Downey Junior gives it his best shot though as always), and the eponymous central character is not particularly compelling. He's interesting in a clinical kind of way but emotionally engaging, no. Despite a strong performance from Murphy, I simply didn't care much about the man.As a result of this focus there is little to be seen of the immense scientific endeavour of the Manhattan Project (the biggest ever at that point in history until the Apollo Programme), and there isn't much about the physics either. There could have been some real dramatic tension over the perceived race against the Nazis to develop an atomic weapon, but this is only referred to a couple of times in throwaway lines.Matt Damon is functional, and we get to learn that Robert himself was a bit of a serial shagger (that was a surprise), but again, so what? Oh, he did shag a lady who was a member of the communist party, so he might be tarred by the same brush. Or he might not. That is not a big enough tension to sustain a three hour movie.The Trinity test is very well done. I have no quibbles about how that is realised, but again so much of the true story of how a team of four thousand scientists laboured for three years to achieve it is simply ignored.The pacing is extremely uneven. A caption announces at the beginning '1. Fission'. Aha, I thought, it is in three acts. But there was no caption for 2 or 3. Perhaps the editor just forgot to put them in. May I suggest for a director's cut that these are '2. Boom!' and '3. The HR Panel Interview Concludes'.Flabby, unfocused and really a bit dull. It could have been so much more, in so much less time.",10,Oppenheimer
"Cillian Murphy's greatest performance yet and another masterpiece by Christopher Nolan. Oscars worthy.Highly recommend although i recommend you give it your full attention when watching otherwise you might miss key elements. But if you've seen Nolan's other films, then you are familiar with his way of portraying timelines.The casting in this was perfect and everyone delivered above and beyond.Also, the way Nolan illustrated Oppenheimer's feelings and emotions was so clever and powerful.The 3 hours flew by. I was entertained and kept engaged throughout the entire film.A terrifying and important event in history beautifully visualized in this film.",10,Oppenheimer
"My goodness, what a disturbing film. I found the first hour to be very slow and a bit hard to follow. I definitely want to give it a second look so I can obtain a clearer understanding of all the different characters and moving parts. But once the intensity begins, it does not let up and it builds and builds and builds until the breathtaking conclusion.I am so grateful that I didn't watch this with my elderly parents as there is some nudity and a couple of unexpected sex scenes within the first half. But I must admit, seeing Florence Pugh naked did not suck.I was quite surprised by the performance of Robert Downey Jr. He plays a wicked dude and plays him very, very well. So convincing. Bravo performance, perhaps his best??Cillian Murphy, my dog. He was stunning. How he could transform into Oppenheimer and capture his conscience and internal struggle the way he did. Just wow, I felt all of that. It was heavy on the soul. When the film ended I literally gasped.Christoper Nolan, simply genius. He created a film here that rocked me to my core. It excites me to know that he is just in his early 50's and has many projects ahead of him ðŸ¤ž He is a rare gem in Hollywood.We completed Barbenheimer today. We started with Oppenheimer and then it was on to Barbie. I recommend that order if you decide to go through with it. In Opp you contemplate the terrifying darkness we humans are capable of. It is true horror and an all to real and unsettling look into our nature. Barbie is a fun little movie with some surprising depth. There were some profound moments where Barbie marvels at the beauty that is present within humanity. Kind of healing and balances things out nicely. What an interesting time in cinema!",10,Oppenheimer
"The life and times of J. Robert Oppenheimer.This is an intense and thought-provoking portrayal of one of the most influential people in history. Much of it is about the demons he carried for developing such a destructive power, and the politics involved in his rise and fall. All of this unfolds in a compelling way. It includes numerous great scenes of dialogue, brilliantly acted by the likes of Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr.The scenes detailing the Manhattan Project are wonderfully constructed with outstanding set design and an incredibly effective reconstruction of the Trinity Test. Do not expect too much scientific detail about quantum physics, nuclear reactions and how the bomb works, as the film focuses more on Oppenheimer's role as a driving force to get it done, his relationship with other key players, his personal life, and the fallout of how he conducted himself during the project and other moments of his career.Visually it is generally fantastic as you would expect from Christopher Nolan, who uses a number of striking images to portray the mental state of the lead character at various points of the story. Plus the sound effects are suitably jarring during shock moments. Oppenheimer gives a victory speech to a crowd at one point when the implications of his actions start to overwhelm him and this is immensely well done.Some moments (Einstein) feel like they are given artistic licence for cinematic reasons, but as long as you research what is fact and what is fiction, alongside watching the movie, you should be better informed. In fact, I would say it is essential that you get background information about certain individuals before seeing the movie, particularly Lewis Strauss, as it will provide context around certain scenes.For me it's a 9.5/10, but I round upwards.",10,Oppenheimer
"Anything that Nolan is involved in, I will go and see, the track record is enough to get me through the doors and on that seat.Oppenheimer represented something of a challenge to me the first time round, after a busy day at work, I went to see it, and at three hours long, after Barbie, it was too much, last night I watched it properly for the second time.As a casual viewer, it's a tough one, but if you're engaged and prepared, this is one outstanding movie. I am on no doubt whatsoever that this film will do very well in terms of awards, the whole cinema was totally immersed, the room was silent.The pacing builds as the film progresses, the second half was the best part, and I loved the ending.It gives some fascinating insight into the life and times of J. Robert Oppenheimer, most of which I knew nothing about, he's a genius, but like all of us, flawed.Cillian Murphy delivers an outstanding, award winning performance, his body language, his delivery, his sheer presence is sublime. Emily Blunt also stood out, she was terrific.I was happy to watch a second time, and no doubt, I'll gladly watch it on blu ray soon enough.9/10.",9,Oppenheimer
"So much has been written here about the brilliance of Cillian Murphy and the ensemble cast, about the cinematography, editing, sound track. And I concur it is a brilliant move on those fronts though a tad too long and heavy in lengthy dialogues in early stages.. However for me the move is incredibly important for bringing to the fore a turning point in the modern human civilization. Ability of humankind to destroy itself without needing any interstellar objects is a haunting prospect and this could be via nuclear weapons or via a more contemporary advances in AI.. The youth and future generations would be well served by watching this movie and being awakened to the destructive possibilities. In 1945, there was arguably a greater horror in the form of Hitler and fascists. Today there are horrors and evil forces but none that pervasive and so we are better served to unite in the thinking and philosophy towards the development and use of weapons of mass destruction.. Before I close off, I am a big fan of Cillian Murphy since Peaky Blinders and there is no better person to have essayed this fascinating character and genius. Watch the movie and make a note to watch it again to learn more ..",9,Oppenheimer
"""Oppenheimer"" is a smarter, more skilled and more serious film than any previous film by the talented Nolan could have led us to expect. It is at once an almost unrivaled biopic, a revealing historical document and a wake up call of gravest importance. As biopic it evokes the vividness of scene and ambiguity of protagonist portrait of the ultimately fictional ""Citizen Kane,"" and even some of that film's wit. As historical document it has the factual specificity of ""All the President's Men."" As historical document it packs the essay-like messaging and dramatic tension of ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"" with comparable virtuosity and stronger final emotional and intellectual impacts.",10,Oppenheimer
"The movie is well directed but somehow the topic seems completely irrelevant. Robert Oppenheimer no doubt did a miracle (biggest curse on mankind, actually) by inventing atomic bomb but do we really require movie on legal events unfolding after the bombing event. Don't think these legal tangles and all are so important in course of history that movie is made out of it. The movies is unnecessarily 3 hours long and sometimes it feels that there is no point in knowing so insignificant events which happened post bombing event. Rather more focus on bomb invention and events leading bomb invention would have been an interesting event.I am perplexed to see so many high reviews about the movie. But I find it pretty average and one would not miss anything in life if he or she skips this movie.What I feel Mr. Chirstopher Nolan is losing its streak actually. Nolan was one of my favourite story teller but with every passing movie I am losing interest in his movies. Batman, Inception, Interstellar were absolute marvels and all time favourites of mine. But then Dunkrik, Tenet and Oppenheimer happend and I feeling his losing his touch on path breaking genre of movies. I feel less and less inclined now a days to watch his movies precisely because of dull topics he selects for story telling. He needs to reinvent himself now and come out with something unique and interesting. He needs to set bar higher than Interstellar.",6,Oppenheimer
"I studied Quantum Physics and I knew Oppenheimer biography before watching this movie so expectations were high. Unfortunately, full 3 hours do not make this much better than trailer - I learned nothing new. Outstanding acting from Cillian Murphy and RDJ, Emily was just blunt, so was Matt Damon's performance. Soundtrack is mediocre although delayed explosion sound made few people jump from their seats. Bomb making is virtually non-existent and there is a a lot of chat in the film, typical for a documentary. If you are late 1 hour for cinema screening, you won't miss anything it is that bad. I probably will never watch this again.",5,Oppenheimer
"As a devoted fan of historical dramas, I can confidently say that ""Oppenheimer"" is an absolute masterpiece! Christopher Nolan has once again delivered an awe-inspiring cinematic experience that leaves the audience spellbound from start to finish.Casting Cillian Murphy as Robert Oppenheimer was a stroke of genius. His portrayal of the conflicted scientist was both nuanced and emotionally charged. He brilliantly captured Oppenheimer's intellect, determination, and moral dilemmas, making the character come alive on the screen. Murphy delivers an Oscar-worthy performance. Also, Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss did an excellent performance. This is by far Downey's best performance, and he also deserves an Oscar nomination. The supporting cast is equally praiseworthy, with outstanding performances from Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and Florence Pugh.From the first frame, the film immerses its audience in a spellbinding narrative that perfectly balances historical accuracy and captivating storytelling. The attention to detail in depicting the era is unparalleled, transporting viewers back to the 1940s and the intensity of the Manhattan Project. The meticulous recreation of the Los Alamos laboratory and the wartime atmosphere adds an authentic touch, making the viewers feel like eyewitnesses to a defining moment in history.The cinematography deserves special commendation, as it brilliantly captures both the beauty of the New Mexico landscape and the intensity of the laboratory's scientific endeavor. The haunting musical score adds an extra layer of depth, heightening the emotional impact of critical moments throughout the movie.""Oppenheimer"" stands as a testament to the power of cinema to educate, entertain, and provoke introspection. It expertly delves into the complex interplay of science, politics, and human morality, reminding the profound implications that scientific discoveries can have on the world.Christopher Nolan has once again proven why he is one of the greatest directors of our time. Brilliantly written, impeccably directed, and expertly performed, the film leaves an indelible impression that will stay with viewers long after leaving the theater.",10,Oppenheimer
"Murphy is an exceptional actor, in the movie he was amazing and helped the actors with him to do their best, The sound effects of the movie is one of the best of all time especially in I-MAX theater, the bombing scene was masterpiece, and of course we know that bombing scene was masterpiece, but the closure scene! Oppenheimer talking to Einstein about the chain reaction they thought it will happen when bombing the nuclear bomb and cause the burning of atmosphere and all the world with it this of course didn't happen, but Oppenheimer realized that he already started it inventing the nuclear bomb knowing that all countries will race to have as many nuclear bomb and even advanced on as they can, and imagining that someday they will start a nuclear war that will destroy all the world. This is a scene that i think i'll never forget for all my lifetime
Overall the film is perfection, everyone did his job in perfect way, and i think cillian finally can has his Oscar award.",10,Oppenheimer
"Fanf***ingtastic! From start to finish. Absolutely loved every second of this incredible movie! Runtime clocks in at 3 hours but it went by very smoothly because there is so much going on. For those wondering, yes you can just dive right in. There's nothing you need to watch to understand what is going on. In fact, other than my time in school the only other times I've heard of any of the scientists in this movie were from the times they were mentioned on the popular tv sitcom The Big Bang Theory. Nolan is one of my favorite directors. His storytelling style may not be for everyone. So far I've loved each of his movies. Nolan joins a very short list of Directors that I don't need a bunch of anything to get me to watch their next story. Nolan has a very unique way in how he presents to you his stories. This one is no different. This movie is shot beautifully, and the practical set in Los Alamos really brought the scenes to life. It is amazing that Nolan was able to do all of this with the use of practical effects and little to no CGI. Let's talk about the music. The music adds elements of horror and intensity throughout. As a matter of fact, throughout the movie my Apple Watch kept going off because my heart rate had spiked high. That's how intense certain scenes got. Every actor in this movie brought their A game. There was such a great balance between all of them. I did like how a little bit of the movie felt like Seven Samurai and this is shown in the Trailer where Oppenheimer and General Groves go out and start recruiting scientists for this amazing, impossible task. I saw this movie in Dolby. Last time Nolan had a movie out I watched it in every format because I couldn't get enough and Oppenheimer is going to be no different. I look forward to watching this in IMAX once I'm able to get a seat. Great flick!",9,Oppenheimer
"This movie gets better the longer you think about it. Everything about the movie is so well done, especially Cillian Murphy's stunning portrayal of Oppenheimer as he realizes what he has done to humanity. The Trinity Test scene was perfectly well done, no horror movie has ever made my heart beat as much as that scene did. Seeing Strauss turn against Oppenheimer was super interesting (RDJ did amazing as him as well). The entire hearing act did a good job at showing how the different motives against Oppenheimer resulted in his downfall. The final scene of the movie is one of the most perfect scenes of any film i've ever seen. Strauss was trying to understand what Oppenheimer said to Einstein that day (assuming it was something to push Einstein against him), but it ended up being something so much more deep. The way the last scene was done was just so chilling and thought provoking, it will stick with you for days after watching it.",10,Oppenheimer
"That you Mr Christopher Nolan for your effort with this fantastic film. You exceeded my already very high expectations - I've been anticipating this film for over six months. Thank you for choosing a fantastic cast to present such a masterpiece. The visual and auditory experience is something I want to experience again, particularly when it's still available in the premium cinemas.I went with a friend that told me they prefer movies to only be about 100 minutes long as he can get fidgety. I am grateful to say that they said that the 3 hours was very enjoyable and didn't feel long at all. In contrast, I admit I was disappointed it wasn't longer :-) but maybe I'm odd in that when I'm watching a great film then I'm happy for it to continue.Do yourself a favor, watch the movie at least once, ideally in a good cinema or at least a way to try to experience the audio and video as best you can.",10,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer is the best movie of the year!It's dense yet never lost me. Although most of the scenes are confronting people, its human-rigor never diminishes. In a way, telling a story like this is one of the boldest decisions any filmmaker, production house could make, for how radical the approach is, with no room for 'assumptions', 'cinematic liberties'.This is one of the fewest times a filmmaker took me into the head of a real-life character who did have real-world consequences of their actions.. that too on a catastrophic scale.The performances are the key here. This movie has some of the most remarkable screen-acting ever in the history! Yes, true.. No exaggeration. Every actor has lived those characters literally.Nolan's structure of telling this story is impeccably commendable. It's dialogue-heavy (as opposed to another 'serious' one - Dunkirk). And No.. it's not social network!But the dialogues are like bullets sometimes and some other times, those subtle whispers that almost sound like mind-voice of Oppy.I sat in the hall several minutes numbed by the film's impact on my senses and psyche.. It hit me very very hard.Nolan - Thank you for making films the way you do. May the courage be with you always.",10,Oppenheimer

"Christopher Nolan does not do anything small, he's a big picture film maker, both in style and theme, in every way, and he brings all of his skills to bear in OPPENHEIMER, his three hour biopic of the man who oversaw the construction of the atomic bomb that ended World War II and then found himself at the center of the contentious politics that followed that conflict. At first glance, the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer would appear to be a tough sell to modern audiences used to the super heroics of the MCU and the DCEU, or franchises like JOHN WICK, THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS, and MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, but Nolan pulls it off not by pandering to the so-called ""modern audience,"" but instead treating them like adults and giving them a cinematic experience which rewards patience and investment.The screenplay by Nolan covers Oppenheimer's prewar years as a brilliant student in Britain and Germany, then as a professor at UC Berkeley, the World War II years with the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, New Mexico, culminating in the successful detonation of the A-Bomb in July of 1945, followed by its use against Japan to end the war. The last section concerns the aftermath as the Cold War rages and Oppenheimer's opposition to the further development of nuclear weapons, specifically the hydrogen bomb, brought him into conflict with powerful men in Washington who retaliated by destroying his reputation. Of course this is not a smooth linear narration, as the film jumps forward at times, and then circles back to put events in perspective and give a fuller picture of what was at stake, and to illuminate the motives of certain historical characters. Much of this action is dialogue driven, with lots of scenes of men sitting at tables and talking, but to Nolan's credit, the pace never lags, and he resists the temptation to explain the dense physics involved. His script is filled with a lot of historical personages played by a huge cast, many of whom have worked with Nolan before: Cillian Murphy in the title role; Emily Blunt as his wife, Kitty; Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock (the Communist Party member with whom Oppenheimer had an affair); Matt Damon as General Leslie Groves; Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss; Kenneth Branagh as Niels Borh; Tom Conti as Albert Einstein; Josh Hartnett as Ernest Lawrence; David Krumholtz as Isidor Rabi; Matthew Modine as Vannevar Bush; Gary Oldman as Harry Truman; James Remar as Henry Stimson; Dane DeHaan as Kenneth Nichols; Casey Affleck as Boris Pash; Jack Quaid as Richard Feynman; Benny Safdie as Edward Teller; Rami Malek as David Hill; Jason Clarke as Roger Robb; Tony Goldwyn as Gordon Gray, and with appearances by Josh Peck, David Dastmalchain, Alex Wolff, and Alden Ehrenreich, who really stands out as a Senate aide who figures a few things out. It says something that many of these actors have only a few minutes of screen time, but Nolan was still able to snag them. It also says something about the script that if you don't know who their characters are, and why they were important, the screenplay does a very good job of conveying why they matter to the narrative.Murphy is superb in the title part, perfectly capturing the great self-confidence of his character in his early years and later as head of the Manhattan Project, but I think Murphy really shines when the guilt at having helped usher in the atomic age takes hold of his character. The later Oppenheimer is a gaunt and haunted figure, and Murphy accomplishes much of this simply with a facial expression or body language. Two other standout performances are by Damon, whose General Groves perfectly captures the hard-driving can do spirit of the military during the war, and RDJ, who makes us totally forget Tony Stark in his portrayal of Lewis Strauss, a self-important insider who ultimately becomes Oppenheimer's nemesis after the war. This reminds us what a powerhouse dramatic actor RDJ really can be. Can't say enough about the cinematography by Hoyte de Hoytema and the score by Ludwig Goransson, and the practical effects during the testing of the Trinity bomb at Los Alamos, which is the dramatic highlight of the film, is far more impactful than anything CGI could produce; this sequence, which comes at the end of the second hour, is what the film has been building to and casts a long shadow over the remaining third.Though Nolan's sympathy clearly does lie with his title character, he does not shy away from the man's faults, he was an unfaithful husband, and possessed more than a little of the overweening self-confidence, even hubris, found in many a brilliant mind. He proved to be a poor communicator for his views of how nuclear weapons should be controlled after the war, and may well have welcomed the investigation by the Atomic Energy Commission, which ended in him being labeled a ""security risk"" for his past associations with known Communists, as a fitting punishment for his work in the development of the bomb. But Nolan deftly and subtly draws a contrast between Oppenheimer and Strauss, the former being a consequential figure because of his accomplishments, and the latter being a self-important and petty man desiring of a greatness that he cannot achieve. I think Nolan handles the complex politics of the era well, covering everything from the American Communist Party's staunch support for the losing side in the Spanish Civil War to the McCarthy era witch hunts. And this is one historical film that stays very far from the simplistic ""woke"" view of history itself. It will certainly reignite the long simmering debate over whether the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were the right thing to do. Some are already knocking the film because there is no depiction of the destruction the bombs wrought in Japan. It's funny how those who are quick to excoriate Oppenheimer, Truman and the other Americans for their role in the dropping of the bombs, never seem to have the same indignation for the leaders of Japan who launched the war in the first place, and then demanded that their people fight on and suffer unimaginable losses after they had clearly lost the war. And what did they think would have happened if Hitler had developed such a weapon? That was the very real fear that drove Oppenheimer, Einstein, and all the others in America who pushed to make this terrible weapon a reality.In the end, I think OPPENHEIMER is a legit contender for being Nolan's best film, at the very least I wasn't scratching my head when it was over unlike TENET. It has a thoughtfulness and intelligence one rarely sees in a major Hollywood production these days and solidifies my opinion that Christopher Nolan is the 21st Century successor to Stanley Kubrick. It's also a great piece of film making, and one that all true lovers of the art form should seek out.",10,Oppenheimer
"A movie about life of Robert Oppenheimer, the focal scientist who helped bring to life the atomic bomb.This was the first movie this year to get me excited to go to back to the movies but this movie ultimately disappointed me in several ways. In the end the negatives outweighed the positives.The good:
Fantastic scoreGood acting overall, especially Cillian Murphy is great, so is Robert Downey JrExcellent cinematographyThe bad:
-Story feels disjointed, time jumps are excessive to the point that is dostracting
Movie tries to pack too much into theee hour runtime and doesn't get it's priorities right. It feels like a series of ""This happened and then that happened"" scenes and a collage of everything in his life. Several prominent characters get introduced in rapid succession and they are gone before you get to know them or to care in the slightest. On the other hand the movie dedicates too much time to things like the courtroom drama and sex scenesUnnecessary sex and nudity, with all the feminist movement these days and considering we're in 2023, we surely should not put sex acenes and nudity only for the sake of it but only if they add to the plot. Unfortunately in Openheimer's case they don't. We see absolute unnecessary sex and nudity in this film that serve no purpose.One last note, there is no reason to watch this movie in IMAX other than an underwhelming explosion scene that takes a maximum of 10 minutes.Despite being a Nolan fan, I have to give this one a 6 overall.",7,Oppenheimer
"I find Christopher Nolan's films very hit and miss, nevertheless I'm still drawn to the cinema in the hope the latest release will be akin to one of my Nolan favourites.Oppenheimer unfortunately for me was a bit of a miss.I could appreciate this was a good biopic to cast on the big screen, however my thinking throughout was this could be better served over a longer series format. Multiple sections of the movie seem skirted over for me and would have been better served going into greater depth, that's even with this being a 3 hours in length.There was a number of characters that were lost in the dialogue, which can be tricky to stick with if you don't have a predisposition to quantum physics. Many character names were quoted and I was scrambling on many occasion to remember which man in the suit and glasses they were referring to, there seemed to be so many of them!Acting performances were solid, which I would expect with the stellar cast on show in this movie.I'd say give it a watch and make your own judgement, but what was one of my more anticipated movies of 2023, I can confidently say won't be one of the standout releases of the year for me.",5,Oppenheimer
"The movie delivers more than i even expected.It's Nolan masterpiece.The story telling was so good and dialogue was so full of emotions and informations about this real life god ( Oppenheimer).The cast was so perfect everyone of ghem did their role so good.Cillian Murphy, Emily blunt, Robert Downey Jr & Florence pugh. And and great Rami Malek and many many others were so perfect.The way they act made me fee like the were the real characters they were representing.Music was from another world flowing through the movie perfectly.The filmmaking was impressive and amazing and the pics & the places we discovered in this movie made me fall in love even more.3 hours felt like 3 mins.This is FILMMAKING in it is PEAK.If Christopher Nolan can't get Oscar on this i really don't know if Oscar really matter if Oppenheimer got dismissed from Oscar as the movie deserves many Oscar prizes for sure.I'm happy i got first release in my country in IMAX.10/10 for me.",10,Oppenheimer
"To make a movie of this standard on a 100 million dollar budget is a significant achievement by a modern filmmaker. For 180 minutes, Oppenheimer narrates a single story and opens up multiple themes like a flower blooming. It is vivid but not obvious, there lies the success of the movie.Nolan follows the same narrative style of Dunkirk, he doesn't show the enemy or the victims but makes us understand the horror through mere sound and imaginations. It is often said that ghosts are scary when they are felt more than they are seen and Nolan attests this statement. The movie goes back and forth with flashbacks in a nonlinear narrative structure, the trademark Nolan style at thos point. But this time the story is connected by a clear set of dots.The Manhattan Project is a very tough story to sell in the commercial space without compromising anti-war and nuclear disarment ideals. To blend in commercial elements in a politically significant storyline is no easy task today and this is the biggest success of Oppenheimer. The movie doesn't read like a Wikipedia page and doesn't use excess prosthetics for the sake of ""transformation"". The actors are well talented in this ensemble and there is a clear trust for their style.While Cilian Murphy is undoubtedly the star of the show, it was Robert Downey Jr who gets the best role of his career. For years he was underutilized in the performance department and was purely used as a mould for the MCU, it is refreshing to see him unleash his acting prowess. While the technical departments are getting their rightful praise, it is the makeup and hairstyling which caught my eye here. Impressive and simple work to create aging, which many fail to grasp.",10,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer is absolutely a testament as to how outstanding Christopher Nolan is in his art of filmmaking.The film is indeed an epic as it presents a story about a scientist whose fascination of the creation of atomic bombs leads to a lot of complexities not just political but even in his personal life.Oppenheimer feels similar to Studio Ghbili's The Wind Rises wherein it does deal with a man who has the love for creating something but his creation used to war. But Nolan's film takes this to a much higher degree with more comprehensive analysis on the characters, not to mention the events he went through.It is a character study and watching the film can make audience not just relate but also bewildered as to the type of man Oppenheimer is - as a scientist, outgoing political man and an ordinary man in general. It also shows the kind of leader he is in handling the project as well as the ups and downs they went through in order to make the first ever atomic bomb.Everyone in the cast was great but Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Were the best ones in the film - truly deserving of Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively.The way the production team managed to re-enact the nuclear bombs is so amazing and it's hard to believe that visual effects had nothing to do with it. Just truly insane.Oppenheimer is already ranking at the top of Christopher Nolan's career to date. With this film alongside Barbie, it is a standout film of 2023.",9,Oppenheimer

"I don't know where to begin. This movie was just so intense. Like every Nolan movie, it has completely enveloped my mind. I'm obsessed with it. It's haunting me.In many ways, it's a big departure for Nolan. Normally his movies have a lot of action, crazy stunts, far out sci-fi plots and most of them are fictional. Even Memento had more action and violence than this. Dunkirk was based on real events in WWII but it barely had any dialogue and was more of an experience, an action/suspense/thriller ride.Oppenheimer truly is a biopic, all about a man and his life. It doesn't try so much to give an objective overall assessment. It feels very personal. It captures the intensity of life. When you reflect over your years and realise the big things which stay with you. Other movies feel so trivial compared to this.The acting is incredible, one of the most impressive casts of all time, mostly male but that's a reflection of the reality. Cillian is great. So many understated and incredibly talented actors seem to come from the UK and Ireland. Oldman is great as well in his brief role - when I saw him, I thought ""of course, who else could play a role like this and pull it off"". He's so good at accents and embodying people.Branagh, Blunt, Downey Jr., the sister from Black Widow, Hartnett, Raiden from Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (a personal highlight) - they're all perfectly cast. Not to mention perhaps 10 to 15 other great performances from other actors. It makes me so keen to learn more about the real people and get back into physics. I miss my university years. Also the aging effects are flawless, for lack of a better word.The music is really effective. I correctly guessed it was Ludwig Goransson again (Tenet), who kind of replaced Hans Zimmer who was busy doing Dune. I really enjoyed it. It felt like an extension of some of those themes. Often heavy in intense, but also contemplative and... intellectual I suppose?I'm now intrigued by Oppenheimer. By being so specific in the details of his life, the movie becomes universal. We might not achieve the same things, have the same fears or make the same mistakes, but we can relate to his emotions and experiences. It's all analogous. And few movies touch on life like this.The pace is blistering. Nolan is great at drawing you in, directing your attention, building to climaxes, using parallel timelines to enhance the meaning and suspense of various events. Now the movie is over, I'm left desperate for more. It's 3 hours long, and it certainly felt long, but it was riveting for that length.I personally have mixed feelings about Oppenheimer's politics. Teachers shouldn't be political in front of students. It's not the right venue. And communism was dangerous, not that different from fascism - just different names for insane, incoherent visions which overrule personal freedom and lead to totalitarianism. But the paranoia surrounding communism and treatment of Oppie was probably unwarranted and unhelpful.The bombing of Japan was necessary. Few alternatives existed at the time. Maybe that could have been emphasised more. But this is a movie and its Oppie's movie. He seems like he was a very intelligent and caring man. His fears are still relevant today. I think deterrents work and it's good that the US has the most nuclear weapons in the world. But it's still scary. What if such weapons get in the wrong hands? We're in a new world.Overall, this movie was highly engaging considering it's 95% talking. It's powerful, memorable and thought-provoking. It doesn't try to go into the scientific details, just what we need to know. It doesn't pander with cliches.It's full of important interactions, just as our lives are. It seems to rush through them. We're left with all these fragments as we try to piece them together. All the standard emotions are there - happiness, sadness, anger, betrayal, redemption, hope, fear, etc.I can't wait to learn more about the real events and watch this again in 6 months or a year. Until then, it's making me reflect on my life and, like very few movies (including Schindler's List and E. T.), it reminds me of the immense weight of life itself. How profound it is.",10,Oppenheimer
"As Cillian Murphy said, this movie will grab you in the neck and make you fully invest in the whole movie. And that's what it did to me. Oppenheimer is a different level of horrifying movie that will stick with you the next, next, day (or your whole life) and just fully ""explode"" your mind. Just be prepared to be on the edge of your seat as this gripping movie takes you on an exhilarating rollercoaster of emotions and suspense.It's the story of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer and his role in the development of the atomic bomb, and when you thought it will end there, no it's not. That's why Christopher Nolan is called the Master of Storytelling and this is one of his most ambitious work. Everything you expected for is nothing you ever wished for. It's moving on very fast-paced, you will miss it if you blink. This movie will played with you, you'll almost never know what's coming. It's 3 hours long run, Nolan could make it 4 hours and I wouldn't even complain.Cinematography? A f-cking painting. Music? A f-cking opera. Acting? A f-cking cinema. Story? A f-cking shakespeare. Directing? A f-cking Christopher Nolan. Just had to write it in Thomas Selby's way. This is a masterpiece. Cillian Murphy and the whole cast deserve an Oscar. The way the whole cast embodied their character and just... this folks, ain't a movie, it's an experience. If you had a chance to watch it on IMAX, you are very lucky.",10,Oppenheimer
"I struggled a little bit - I mean it is the obvious pun (that as always is not intended - never ever, yes?), so should I take the easy one? Well as you can see: I did. There were a few others I considered yesterday ... but none that really would have ... the impact of this one (yes I can't stop - like Oppenheimer himself maybe?) ... one if you are really that curious involved Asteroid City - not just because they came out this year - you also had many talented actors in it and a setting in the desert. Although it was mainly desert for AC and only partly for Oppenheimer of course.Not to mention many more differences - anyway let's not waste more time on that. And time you'll need, because this is a 3 hour affair! Still and even while I once looked on my watch (2 hours in), I was never bored or annoyed by the running time. While we know Nolan knows his stuff technically - sometimes some viewers may have issues with the story. Now depending on your knowledge of history, you may find certain things interesting and others less so.Apparently there is one huge ""mistake"" with flags being from a different era (decade) than the one they are used in. Since it is done in color (something Nolan admitted would be a subjective telling of happenings), that might have been on purpose. But small things like that should not deter you from liking or disliking the movie. A friend also pointed out that a spy related ""fact"" was not entirely accurate. Using """" in both instances to make clear I am not saying it is so ... kind of like Christopher Nolan you say? Well thank you so much.As already mentioned, the movie has colored and black and white segments. The latter being the ones that are supposed to be historically accurate. I can't vouce for total authenticity - and the movie may bring up questions you may want to research. Be it certain people or incidents. Oppenheimer - this is as close as we'll get to know or rather see him. From a safe distance - same goes for the ... bomb (yes another pun).The actors are amazing, though it felt that Emily Blunt was underused at first. Not knowing the real wife of Oppenheimer, I imagined that was just the way she was. But behold she will get her time to shine and be more than a two dimensional character. Another character in Nolan films is his editing style and his insistence not to use CGI - which is quite impressive. Even more so here ... all the stuff that is ... well even the small stuff you see on screen here. There are so many visual treats that I am amazed he did practical ... and there is even more to discover.Even without being a scientist you can easily follow the main theme of the movie. You will not get a lecture (again sorry and you're welcome) ... well not a full one at least. Even if you are not down with the movies theme - you can't deny the sheer power that Nolan releases (well Oppenheimer in that case - although even he didn't do it all by himself - he surrounded himself with the best people he could - kind of like Nolan? Well if you say so) ... and with that I say til next time - chances hopefully are way better than near zero you like my review.",10,Oppenheimer
"Give it up to Christopher Nolan he knows how to make an Imax picture and he's dictated to this format like no other. Other filmmakers who say they make movies in IMAX are cheating you just a little. Like the last good IMAX movie, Mission: Impossible Dark Reckoning. Christopher McQuarrie knows all the good action scenes to put into IMAX to cheat you out of the entire flick being IMAX but Nolan is not about that and that makes for a beautiful motion picture.But I have to admit, going into this I was thinking Oppenheimer would be like Independence Day in the sense that I came to see something blow up and once that happen, I was done. This movie is soo long and it kept going. I forgot that this movie was about the man that created the bomb not the bomb itselfOverall, Nolan's tells the story of John Oppenheimer and he tells a great story and made a visually stunning movie out of it. One of his best.",9,Oppenheimer
"With great expectations, I went to watch this film, and returned home totally disappointed. Very much shallow plotted with so many people to remember. I don't prefer watching this at theater. Many of us intended to leave in the middle while the movie was running. To me, it is a overhyped movie. However cinematography and casting were good. I expected better from Mr. Nolan. This movie could have ended within 1 hour and 20 minutes. At this point of time, movies should have had some points which will hook the audience. But I did not find anything like that in this movie. I should have watched Barbie instead. Nevertheless, best of luck.",6,Oppenheimer
"Boring movie, which is mostly political court room scenes.They don't show the Japan bombing but probably because we were ment to see it from oppenheimer's point of view, to which I found the Trinity scene very underwhelming, looks like they just blowed up a big barrel of gasoline. Some unnecessary nude Florence Pugh scenes, which is quite unusual for Nolan.The acting was excellent. But there is too much dialogue and characters being introduced every scene.The part where he is supposed to speak Dutch in Leiden, Netherlands, is not the Dutch language at all. Sounded more like German. Overall 3/10, the movie could have been shorter.",3,Oppenheimer
"Plays like a chain reaction, bouncing between past and present, actions and consequences. This is a blistering piece of filmmaking that's only flaws are small shortcomings from its gargantuan ambitionElevated by Cillian Murphy's exacting performance, Nolan's biopic on the father of the atomic bomb is majestic and morally complex.The cinematography is magnificent no worries when you have Hoyte Van Hoytema, capturing the awesome power of a bomb while also showcasing the vulnerability and flaws of the humans that created it.Ludwig GÃ¶ransson Soundtrack is surreal it will make you on your toes.For me it will always be Robert Downey Jr. And Cillian Murphy Performances that carried this movie everybody else was just ok.It's not Nolan's best movie it will always be Inception for me but it's up there with the top, A great cinematic experience that you don't want to miss especially in IMAX.",9,Oppenheimer
"Everything about this film is top notch: acting, lighting, sound, dialogue, everything worked perfectly telling a very technical and detailed story. Well done.There were no small parts in the film. Every character was integral to the story. I see multiple award nominations and wins for this great cast. Cillian Murphy is wonderful in the lead role and his portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer has you believing at times your watching a documentary. I have been a Robert Downey Jr fan for a vey long time and this was probably his greatest performance.I am usually not a big fan of jumping around multiple timelines but this film was so well done it worked to perfection.",10,Oppenheimer
"The rain halts. Scent of dampened soil permeates, soon to be overwhelmed by that of sweat and lumber. Crimson are the signal lights, as if candles ignited for a sacred ritual, guiding all attention to the dark tower. Simple words are spoken, but at the volume of infinity; the music crescendos. Afar, soldiers lay low in postures of worshipping, solemnity in the eyes behind black goggles. The hatted man nods, the hand quivers, the number zeros. There is silence, and then, there is light.Such is the sequence that glued me to my chair and infatuated me with Nolan's artistry. Despite getting crushed by Barbie in box office, Oppenheimer, in my opinion, is a work of sincerest dedication, and will be remembered as a biographical film of the highest standard.I have no technical term that summarizes Nolan's directing genius, but the result speaks for itself: rhythmically engrossing narration, temporally convoluted storylines, and intriguingly concise buildup. At first, the exposition seems hasty and aimless to me, with too many dangling threads, yet Nolan manages to return to every of those planted seeds at the most unexpected but appropriate timing, sewing individual strings into the most ravishing of embroideries. Per usual, aestheticism, editing, and soundtrack are spot-on --- I do see area of improvement for the last one though, as there is no motivic melody that sticks, just ambient accompanies.A lot more could be said about the movie's philosophy, but personally it all centers around the word ""contradiction"". Oppenheimer is a contradicted man whether in terms of romance, belief, or ethic. His tragedy is his humanhood: human to bare unparalleled intelligence, to bare collective ambitions, and to bare the entirety of guilt. Although imperfect, at least Oppenheimer realizes that all that has happened is above him or his colleagues, which makes him spiritually superior to Strauss, who is limited to mere fame and ego.Phenomenal film, but definitely not a commercial one. I hope Oscar gives Nolan and Murphy some recognition this time.",8,Oppenheimer
"A movie that has a poetic description of the life of Robert Oppenheimer. When you do a favour for your own country, but not for the humanity. "" No good deed goes unpunished"".A tragic story of a man questions his morality in order to serve his country, and ""for the greater good"". However, the questioning haunted Oppenheimer that led him to try to encourage governments to stop building World Mass Destruction. But its too late, humanity are doomed by their own creation. Humanity are destined to have blood in their hands ""for their own good"".Plot : 10/10

"Christopher Nolan has done it again with his latest release of Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer is a mind bending epic biopic of the father of the Atom bomb. Now please note this movie might not be for everyone because it is extremely dense with heavy dialogue and stays true to the real life story in life of Oppenheimer. Those who are expecting an action extravagansa will be sadly disappointed. I really enjoyed the visual journey that this film takes you on and it is amazing to me that Nolan used zero CGI shots in this film. This star studded movie showcases some amazing Oscar worthy performances from all of it's Leads with Cillian Murphy, Roberty Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt. Even the smaller roles bring all of their A games. I got the opportunity to watch this in 70mm Imax and when I say this is truly how Nolan wanted you to see it as intended, I mean it. The movie was breathtaking and such an important film to see in this day in age. Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer gets a perfect 10 out of 10 for me. Also I would rank it as one of Nolan's best films ever!",10,Oppenheimer
"When I was leaving the car, heading to the theatre, my expectations were really low. Then, when I bought the ticket, the trailer was playing on a TV, and I thought I was being stupid by thinking a Christopher Nolan movie would be boring and would suck.When I entered the theatre, the movie started, and my brain turned to this masterpiece!This movie is one of the movies of the century. It's a great never-seen idea, has an excellent story, really well told, and these visuals and cameras are amazingly brought to us from another world.When I leave the theatre with my friends, we were discussing the movie, talking about how good it was. We never thought the atomic bomb story would be like this.The story is amazing a it fells like we're watching everything happening. This movie deserves a lot of Oscars.Stop what you're doing, (unless if what you're doing is watching the movie or buying tickets for it) and go watch this movie! This is one of the great Nolan masterpieces! It deserves your attention.",10,Oppenheimer
"It wasn't quite the masterpiece I was hoping for, but Oppenheimer is still a really fantastic movie.Cillian Murphy is terrific and the supporting cast is honestly insane. This might beat The Thin Red Line for the amount of big name actors that show up. Robert Downey Jr. Stole the show. I did feel like Emily Blunt was a bit wasted though. She has one really good scene, but she's mostly just the ""wife"" character.The cinematography, editing, music; it's all top-notch, even if most of the visuals don't really make it a ""must see in IMAX"" movie. The detonation sequence is absolutely breathtaking though.It did start to feel a bit overdramatic at points, with plot twists and lots of shouting courtesy of Jason Clarke's almost cartoonishly evil character. Plus there are times where (despite it's uniquely Nolan structure) it does feel like a rather standard biopic, especially in the first act. That feeling doesn't stick for very long though since the whole thing is so well put together.In the end, I would say this is easily one of my favorite Nolan films. It's great to see him tap into more emotional themes, even when there are still some issues. Also, I absolutely loved the ending.",9,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer is a breathtaking masterpiece that earns a resounding 10 out of 10! This cinematic gem, directed by the genius Christopher Nolan, transports audiences to the fascinating world of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. From start to finish, the film captivates with its compelling storytelling and remarkable performances.Cillian Murphy delivers a tour-de-force performance as Oppenheimer, flawlessly capturing the complex emotions and moral dilemmas faced by the brilliant physicist during WWII. The supporting cast, including Marion Cotillard and Tom Hardy, adds depth and charisma to the narrative, leaving viewers in awe of their talent.Nolan's direction is nothing short of visionary. His signature mind-bending narrative style keeps us engrossed, blending historical accuracy with a touch of speculative fiction. The visuals are stunning, making the era come alive with meticulous attention to detail.Hans Zimmer's riveting score heightens every scene, intensifying the drama and suspense. The use of practical effects and seamless CGI elevates the film, leaving audiences on the edge of their seats during the heart-pounding action sequences.What sets Oppenheimer apart is its philosophical exploration of the consequences of scientific progress and the moral implications of creating the atomic bomb. The film strikes a perfect balance between historical accuracy and artistic interpretation, prompting thought and reflection long after leaving the theater.Oppenheimer is a monumental cinematic achievement that deserves every accolade it receives. This gripping portrayal of one of history's most influential figures will undoubtedly go down as one of Nolan's finest works. If you seek an enthralling, thought-provoking, and visually stunning experience, this film is an absolute must-see!",10,Oppenheimer
"This is the second film of Nolan's I have watched that features historical events and characters. For such a monumental slice of human history, this movie fails to emphasize the most important bits. It most certainly did not scratch the itch that I had developed when I found out it existed!Nolan works wonders when he handles original ideas and Batman films. However, I have been disappointed too many times by him forcing originality into things that people are already familiar with.Chris, sometimes we just want to see historical events visualized outside the documentary format. You don't need to try to prove how intelligent you are in every movie you make... You're butchering history just like Netflix does. Just, in a different way... I'm just disappointed that this wasted opportunity will now discourage others from making an Oppenheimer/Manhattan Project movie because it will have been already made. Or has it?",6,Oppenheimer
"For me this movie doesn't do anything. The acting is good but that is the only thing that is likeable. There is simply nothing interesting (for me that is) about this movie.There aren't any beautiful shots or suspenseful parts. If there was anything happening then the long runtime would have been fine but now it feels like a chore to sit through.You already know the outcome of making the atomic bomb and you already know America was the first to use one. The only new information about the man for me was the part about his personal life but it wasn't anything to write about apart from making the A bomb, and that is not enough to make a movie about.Once again, my opinion, maybe I am not seeing something about this that others did see. Or I simply do not get it.",3,Oppenheimer
"Wow. This film...Is just wow.If there aren't any acting nominations for this film I will be very very surprised.RDJ in my opinion was incredible.Obviously Cillian Murphy was outstanding.Matt Damon wasn't as bad as I thought he would be.I wasn't expecting a lot of the sex scenes tbh. But fair play to Florence Pugh.For me the music in a film matters so much. And I came out of that thinking ""Hans Zimmer must've composed it surely ?"", but no.... Ludwig Goransson !!! Mad. Big up. It was outstanding.The pay off after the Trinity test was immeasurable.I also found the final climax in the third act was well worth the wait, even though the final act did drag a little.The scenes with Einstein were incredible. And Gary Oldman in one scene blew me away !!! I'm watching it again this weekend.I studied this part of history in some detail and to see it on screen was a real treat.This film is a 9/10 for me. Outstanding.PS: Rami Malek ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚",9,Oppenheimer
"The story behind the father of the atomic bomb.I enjoyed this movie to be sure! It is surprisingly thrilling and suspenseful despite having literally no true suspense or thrill scenes to speak of. The writing is great, the filmography spectacular, and for many actors this movie has proved to me that they can indeed act!Some issues I have with it are the difficulty in following the story during the first act. But once the audiences is used to the format it is easy to follow. I also could have done away with the fairly explicit sex scenes. One could argue that the one serves a purpose, but most nudity was unnecessary and didn't add to the plot.Nevertheless, the movie does well in keeping its titular character a controversial figure, and excels in suspense through conversation.",8,Oppenheimer
"Not your typical Nolan pic but that's a good thing.Beautifully acted and shot. Fantastically expansive and engaging. Saw it in IMAX though it was not necessary. Wonderfully cinematic score. Love the use of percussion.Highly recommended for history, cinephiles, and Nolan fans. I predict accolades all around and if this doesn't sweep awards season I would be SHOCKED.Fun fact, no CGI. Everything is practical affects. The film is long (3 hours) so choose your breaks in the first hour.Wonderfully surprised by the political story as well. I had no idea. Nolan did a great job of making him human and not judging.",10,Oppenheimer
"Christopher Nolan can be immensely proud of the overall performances of all of his cast in 'Oppenheimer', however a certain Mr Murphy, stands out.From the get go, the film sets the tempo of which Nolan is known for - you're hanging on the edge of your seat, sweating and gripping the handles. We all know the eventual outcome of the science that goes on in this film but it really does make you think 'what if'... the risks taken to proceed with the project were straight insanity.Nolan needs to stick to this era, he smashed it with 'Dunkirk' and now 'Oppenheimer' continues a great trend. Perhaps Nolan could next venture into the Vietnam war or even WW1?Must see movie!!",10,Oppenheimer
"I enjoyed it a lot despite its long time.It passed well. There some boredom, but it's good teamwork.Of course, nothing justifies what happened, and no one can be blamed, because everyone was responsible for what happenedBut as a re-creation of what happened.Robert Downey Jr. Excelled as usual, as did Cillian Murphy, and directed
It was very creative, especially the nuclear explosions. Maybe I wanted more and expected better, but I haven't seen a movie in the cinema for a long time. So it's something promising for me.Certainly not as cool as Interstellar.Nothing beats it. It was a long time ago but I still love it.",8,Oppenheimer
"Director Christopher Nolan has to be praised for coming up with another very good film, after THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, TENET and others. He connects technology with the human mind more successfully than any other director I can think of these days.That said, OPPENHEIMER suffers from the same overlength problem that had already hurt INCEPTION: Mr. Nolan seems to like 3-hour long movies.Cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema rates extremely high order, the same going for art direction and editing.Acting also deserves praise across the board, even if I felt that Matthew Modine, Anton Kushner and a few other well known actors had to accept largely insignificant, tiny roles just to be part of a prestigious production.The male lead, Cillian Murphy, will probably get Best Actor awards next year. He plays the Hamlet-like figure of J. (a letter that stands for nothing, he admits) Robert Oppenheimer, a physicist/scientist who goes to England, Germany, Austria and other places where WWII would rage soon after, and he sees several women with different kinds of affection and a general distance that he also keeps in relation to communism and politics, prompted to a large extent by his consuming interest in quantum mechanics, and later in the Los Alamos Project, the H and atomic bombs, and above all the human resourcing around the entire project.Murphy looks much older than he does in real life, mirroring the sucked in facial structure of the real Oppenheimer, almost like the face of death. He is on screen most of the time and delivers a top notch performance that reflects his Jewish background and how he senses the danger of Hitler's rise to power and Nazi domination. He brims with intelligence, a scientist's mental abstraction, a remoteness reflected in his relationship with his children (never on his mind, he even asks Chevalier, who he is cuckolding with the lovely Britt Kyle, to keep his oldest child for a while), and the difficulty of steering the course at the helm of a project buffeted by so many contrasting and shifting interests, right up to President Truman's, and including the ignominiously vindictive Lewis Strauss, superbly played by Robert Downey, who also looks much older than in real life, and who came to be viewed as the villain in the AEC proceedings that saw Oppenheimer lose his security clearance.Emily Blunt shines as Oppenheimer's ignored, betrayed wife, who has to look after the children and do house chores while hubby engages in his scientific quests. She encourages him to continue his work even when he feels dejected by the politics surrounding his overwhelming assignment, and urges him to fight to clear his name instead of adopting the Hamletian posture that he seems unable to drop. In the end, she symbolizes the defender and guarantor of the values in the Constitution, even if they get trampled by the military wanting a bomb at all costs and quickly to end the war with Japan, presidential design, and all manner of envy that is typical of such high-powered jobs and duties.I would have liked the film to explain more clearly the importance of dropping the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to beat Russian plans to take Japan, besides the obvious desire to reduce human casualties caused by war, even if at the cost of millions of Japanese lives, and for several generations.OPPENHEIMER offers some insight into pre-, war, and postwar times though, inevitably, history and the actual truth may not have survived unscathed.To conclude, I liked it very much, found it gripping throughout. 8/10.",8,Oppenheimer
"Here is what you need to know. Oppenheimer is one of the best films of the decade. This is a film you must see, regardless of whether or not you watch a lot of movies. See it on the biggest IMAX screen you can. It is as much an engrossing document of vital history as it is an unparalleled sensory experience. This film is of course about the invention of nuclear weaponry, and of course, you'll get up close and personal to a real detonation. But that's nowhere near the thrill behind Oppenheimer. In fact, there isn't supposed to be one. Oppenheimer is a blistering indictment of the bomb's creation and a passionate anti-war plea. What's more, is that this is a masterful character study about the man behind the bomb, and the agonizing regret he felt about creating it in the first place.J. Robert Oppenheimer was a curious physicist who in one lifetime received the ultimate praise and the ultimate ire from the nation he belonged to. Summoned by the U. S. military, he served as the brains behind the Manhattan Project and the creation of the first, second and only atomic bombs ever used in battle. For that moment, Oppenheimer brought about the brutal end of a world war, but that was exactly the problem. A brutal end to a brutal war, and forever, the world had changed. Oppenheimer gave birth to the first weapon of mass destruction, and every nation on earth wanted one of their own. The arms race was on. The end of the world, suddenly, a possibility. If that weren't enough already, his greatest scientific ally betrays him in a stunning act of jealousy and personal enrichment, leading to a demoralizing persecution at the hands of the U. S. Government at the height of the red scare.Oppenheimer becomes the physical manifestation of guilt and yes, death. Wracked with unending pain, we see his body begin to consume itself. His eyes stare straight into the abyss. His frame, gaunt and emaciated. Always seemingly on the verge of tears. Cillian Murphy delivers an unforgettable performance that I struggle to think won't land him an Oscar next year. For three hours, Murphy is spellbinding, and that is incredible given the fact that for the most part, he is simply talking with other people. Oppenheimer, by that affect, is not a laborious chore to sit through, but instead, a living and breathing historical account. Robert Downey Jr., as the backstabbing Lewis Strauss is instantly the clear front runner for Best Supporting Actor in a performance that mirrors F. Murray Abraham in Amadeus.Oppenheimer is many great movies in one, and for Christopher Nolan, that comes with so much ease. In every aspect, he approaches the material with the gravity it deserves and not once does it meander and and lose focus of the core information behind the story. That unto itself is a tremendous undertaking, and without a doubt, Nolan passes that test.",9,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer is by no small margin the most profound movie I've ever seen. It is no exaggeration to say that this film is a work of genius. Not just on part of the directing and screenplay, but interestingly enough, the editing. In a 3-hour movie, there wasn't a single wasted frame. The editing and sound design played such pivotal roles in the film in adding layers of depth beyond even the script and dialogue. I never thought I'd see a movie that has quite literally no action whatsoever but never-the-less never a dull moment. Every scene is pertinent, every line explosive and powerful. Featuring one of the most star-studded casts I've ever seen (I recognized every actor in the movie) giving the performances of their lifetimes, I strongly suspect everyone from the director, editor, writer, composer to the majority of the cast will receive tons of well-deserved accolades for this feature. I went in expecting it to be very good and very powerful. I came out experiencing a masterpiece of cinema, one I'm likely never to forget.",10,Oppenheimer
"The IMDb community will tar and feather me for giving it anything less 9 stars, but I have to be honest here. I thought it was good, not great. It was certainly not my favorite Nolan film.That said, there are undoubtedly some amazing elements to Oppenheimer. The acting, cinematography, and music are all exceptional. I had the privilege of watching it in the original 70 mm format, which was glorious. But even with all of its upsides, this wasn't a perfect movie.Nolan's fixation for nonlinear timelines can sometimes create confusion for the sake of art. The idea of it is fascinating in his science fiction films like Tenet and Interstellar, but was it really necessary in a period piece/biopic?Mind you, Nolan's non-linear storytelling isn't limited to just sci-fi. It was done flawlessly in his film Momento, which wasn't a sci-fi movie. But in Memento, it played a crucial element to the plot. In my opinion, Oppenheimer could have been better as a single linear timeline.Finally, I thought it was a bit too long.I found myself wondering when the film would end at around the 2h 15m mark. The last 45 minutes was like that work meeting that could have just been covered in an email. There was a lot of information that felt superfluous.I know a lot of people love it, and they're not wrong. I just had a different opinion.",6,Oppenheimer
"For the first 30 minutes the movie is Dr Oppenheimer being introduce to other Drs. Endlessly. From there in the film develops into the biographical tale of Oppenheimer's progress from theorist to professor to manager of one of the most life changing science projects in history. Now, Opp isn't a nice guy. He cheats on his wives, he drops his friends in with the rabid Commie hunters in the US at the time, and he doesn't appear to have any outwardly regrets at what he has helped create. Nolan has the, brilliant, Murphy, internalising his ""pain"", but it's all rather meh. There is a long drawn out trial, but not a trial, intended to discredit Oppie. And it's never clear that it actually does. Robert Downey Jr is portrayed as a snidey turncoat for apparently being belittled by Oppie. Yeah, okay. What the audience was really being built up for was the nuclear testing. The real drama. Can the Atom Boys build it in time!!! (I'm not going to spoil this bit). So we get to the testing, in full 70mm and sensurround, Dino vision and double Dolby. And... It's a bit of a let down in I'm honest. We see an explosion. In quite a bit of darkness. That's it. Now this may well reflect what happened. But this is the movies. Nolan could have used some artistic licence to enhance the viewing experience. And after that there is an inexorable meander towards the frankly bland ending. It's well made, really well acted, in particular by Murphy and RDJ, but it could have had 45 minutes of it edited down to a less bum numbing run time and there could have been a bit more sciencey bits on relation to the bomb. Would have been a much better experience as a 3 part TV mini series. Don't hate me.",5,Oppenheimer
"Christopher Nolan has created something truly unique. A biopic that is deep, intense, emotional, complex, makes you think, and actually hits you physically through sound... At least in Imax...This is a movie for the ages. There are so many incredible bits, lines, moments, some that feel frozen in time and make you actually ""feel how they felt""... The casting is simply A++ list, including a few surprises, and they're all on their A++++ game... Robert Downey Jr delivers like his life depended on it, Hartnett reminds you of why he was such a hot topic back in the day, Damon is perfect, and Murphy... I mean... it's about time somebody gave that guy a role of this magnitude because he was born for this level of acting....This is one of the ""must watch"" movies of a lifetime. I can see why it wouldn't vibe with some people, but I'm sure most folks will experience the movie in a very intense, rewarding way.",10,Oppenheimer
"This is a slow-burn grown-up movie that doesn't rely on CGI, swooshes and/or thuds to make us think we're watching something good. The science seems to be lacking (Oppie was a scientist), but this is a biography, not a Manhattan project development tale (read Rhodes' ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"" for that). And given this, so is missing a thorough character development of the protagonist. In the end, we know he succeeded yet cannot pinpoint just how that happened: we know that Groves, aptly played by Damon, was outrageously difficult for a scientist to deal with. The IMAX format was not necessary as the visuals/sets don't get a boost from it. It just has no grand visual elements. But the story and subject matter held my attention. Blunder: I was sorry to (not) see a proper epilogue noting the very recent posthumous reinstatement of Oppenheimer's security clearance. Costuming was poor: 1940s men always wore hats and shirts that were (only) white. Aside from hairstyles (and period autos) the piece felt too modern. Truman's Whitehouse was quite authentic. But it does what a flick is supposed to do: entertain! 8/10.",8,Oppenheimer
"Best Cinematic Movie of 2023 and OSCAR NOMINATED 2024. Oppenheimer, could be, one of the best biographical movie ever existed. It does have a lot of ""heavy"" conversations but man, it leaves a strong impression and it is so compelling that made me speechless.Star-studded cast was not just for nothing, they truly, truly delivers each character perfectly. Especially Cillian, damn, brilliant performance. I truly wish that I could watch it in IMAX 70mm, the way they originally filmed it with.It is three hours long but I highly recommend you guys to watch Oppenheimer in the best theatre you could find in your city. Yes its gonna be boring if you're just accompanying your friend or S/O without actually intended to invest your time in this.",10,Oppenheimer
"If you somehow still didn't know Cillian Murphy before watching this film, you'll most certainly never forget him after you've finished. This man has been brilliant in every role he's performed in, but what he accomplished in this film is nothing short of perfection. Christopher Nolan remains the greatest director / filmmaker on the planet, and it's not even close. With the already incredible catalogue he's given us, this just might be his best yet. He makes a 3 hour film feel as if only half an hour has passed. The tension, the love, the scenery, the heartbreak, and the terror.....I mean, it's all there.""It's not for you. It's for them.""My heart hurts just thinking of that line.Bravo.",10,Oppenheimer
"If this film don't win Nolan an Oscar, I'm not sure what will!Brilliant acting, loud and magnificent soundtrack, and the mesmerizing end scene. All of these factors are undoubtedly amazing.""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic masterpiece that leaves audiences captivated and moved. The film brilliantly portrays the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. With stellar performances, compelling storytelling, and stunning visuals, it delves into the complexities of science, ethics, and human nature. A must-watch for history buffs and anyone seeking thought-provoking cinema. Truly an unforgettable experience! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",10,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer is a great film but not without its flaws. No matter how minor or major those flaws, this isn't a flawless film.Christopher Nolan's direction is fantastic and cinematography are just as great. Maybe not one of his best jobs behind the camera but he still made a film like Oppenheimer, that is very intimate and small scale still feel epic. He is one of the last true ""filmmakers.""Now the best job Nolan did with Oppenheimer is the script. I personally think besides maybe Memento and The Prestige, Oppenheimer is the best script his ever written. The dialogue honestly sounded like it was written by a different person. The words just snapped on the screen. Some of the most buzzy dialogue he's ever written.Onto the acting, Cillian Murphy carries the film clearly as J. Robert Oppenheimer but it's more than him just being the main character as all of Hollywood seems to be in the film. His acting is never overshadowed by anyone else and he really deserves an Oscar nom for his performance, one of the best of the year and of his career. Also another actor who deserves an Oscar nom is Matt Damon as Gen. Leslie Groves. His performance is maybe the most showy of the film but he brought some levity and some must needed humor to the film. I think he did a very great job. Now this may be an unpopular opinion but Robert Downey Jr performance just didn't resonate with me. Im he did a fine job and honestly I feel this way because.....The non linear way the story is told is as confusing as some Nolan films but RDJ's character gets lost with the story jumping around time periods. I wasn't quite sure why he was so resentful for Oppenheimer until the last 20 minutes and I suppose that's the point but I couldn't help but think if the story was told in a linear way Downey's character and performance would sat better with me. He is technically the villain in the film but I never got a real sense of that until the very end. I Hope Nolan one day decides to tell a story other than Batman in a traditional fashion. It really could've benefited from it in Oppenheimer.This leads me to the women characters. Emily Blunt & Florence Pugh are both very great in the film but their characters are so underwritten and really have no purpose in the story that's being told. ""Kitty"" played by Emily Blunt is just constantly drunk and hates her life and Florence Pugh's character as a colleague and mistress of Oppenheimer is also a crazy suicidal person. Now this is a true story but for a film about the making of the atomic bomb I don't quite see how these 2 characters in the film were necessary especially for the way they are written and portrayed. For those 2 prestige actresses to basically be drunk and suicidal and having no real baring on Oppenheimers life seemed odd to me. Although Emily Blunt has one of the most memorable scenes in the film while being interrogated. I just felt those actresses could've been used more and had more to do then besides be drunk and hate themselves.Lastly... The Score. It honestly was completely overbearing and distracting for 2/3rds of the film. In every scene where 2 or a group of people are talking in a small room there is a very loud and bombastic score behind it which is utterly annoying. I know this is a Nolan film and every second of screen time needs to be epic but in a film like this that score throughout the entire film was completely unnecessary. If that was cut back considerably my score might be higher than 8 but in certain scenes that I think we're meant to feel powerful because of the dialogue I either could barely hear the words being said or they lost impact but of the obnoxious music playing behind it.Oppenheimer will be one of the best films 2023 for sure. Besides the score and the women being underwritten it's pretty darn amazing. Cillian Murphy for best actor please.",8,Oppenheimer
"The skills of each of the actors plus bringing this skill out of them onto to the big screen by the man with the golden movie ticket (pun intended) Christopher Nolan is very commendable.The background score does it's job of keeping the nuclear explosion sounds a tad underplayed, although the race aspect of building the bomb is never lost with the ticking sounds.The crowds cheering for Oppenheimer in adulation and joy of victory was more overpowering than the bomb. This is the subtle message that was successfully delivered from my point of view.Imagine staring into the screen with those intense eyes having so much to convey but so little that the world undersands from Oppenheimer's POV. Cilian Murphy after having just a couple of almonds day in and day out has just given his best although I was an equal fan of his prior acting skills after having watched his scarecrow portrayal repeatedly. Just superb.The drama that unfolds later is although a bit lengthy was a necessary aspect in building the intricate thinking by Strauss (pronounced Straws) just to prove that his ideology was better than that of Oppenheimer. But more aptly, as a revenge of being ignored by scientists of the time due to Oppenheimer making fun of him in a courtroom. It is a valid motive and Robert Downey Jr does complete justice to the role.The critical piece of the movie is how the complexity is derived by using excellent editing skills mixed with fantastic visuals and background music. This makes for a perfect entertainment for a cinephile along with a thought provoking exit from the movie hall - to bring us to the reality of the world we live in. The chain reaction has begun!!!On a fun note, let's all read Bhagavad Gita and any such books that lead us to enlightenment - just my perspective give or take 😏",10,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer might be the best Nolan's film I've watched. Much better than Interstellar and the Dark Knight trilogy.The acting, storytelling, the score and visuals were just amazing in it. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight.This movie proves that Cillian Murphy is a lead actor. The deliverance and his eye movement was a treat of it's own. I couldn't have picked a better actor to play Oppenheimer.RDJ showed us that he can still roll with the big boys of the industry and everyone was just amazing in it.This movie isn't just a story how the atomic bomb was made, but also how Oppenheimer and the entire staff of his scratched and clawed to ""victory"". As a viewer, you immediately join them on this adventure and you feel every bit of tension in this film.The trinity test was the highlight of the movie. It took my breath away and made me feel part of the crew as they saw the bomb explode in front of their eyes.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a silent reminder that cinema is not dead.",9,Oppenheimer
"I have to admit: Oppenheimer didn't live up to the hype for me. This is not a bad film per se and while it depicts a frightening turning point in history, its style didn't suit me.Overall I think it's too densely packed and there isn't a payoff for the 3-hour runtime. I didn't feel emotionally connected to any of the characters because they are underdeveloped. There are different timelines, subjects and characters that get introduced and are gone before we get to known or care for them. Plus, the movie is overly dialogue-heavy and politically oriented for its own good. I enjoy engaging conversations but it's filled with technical dialogue, hearings and bureaucracy, which doesn't work for me. I might as well read a book or a Wikipedia page.I will, however, praise the acting of the entire cast and the immersive score and sound design. I wish I could say the same about the visual effects but I found what we were presented underwhelming.",7,Oppenheimer
"Overambitieus movie with too many stories to tell that does not manage to tell any of the stories really well because of it. I truly don't understand the high ratings. I was bored to death the last hour with the whole overextended communist drama. Also, the was little character building. Instead the viewer is thrown from scene to scene for the first ninety minutes. The movie doesn't allow you to draw you along further in any scene than surface level which makes many scenes shallow. I felt like sitting through church when I was a little boy. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. I feel mentally raped.",5,Oppenheimer
"This week has seen one of the craziest times for cinema with the release of both Barbie and this film Oppenheimer. Hopefully, this gives cinema the shot in the arm that it needs and truly provides some great cinema. I have seen Oppenheimer and here is my review for the film. The premise of the film examines the life of Robert Oppenheimer, the man who was behind the development of the atomic bomb.Main Character
Cillian Murphy and director Christopher Nolan have been linked for many years and it is finally time for him to be the lead performance as Oppenheimer and he is incredible. This is easily one of the best performances of 2023 and I guarantee that he will be getting an Oscar nomination for this performance. He depicts the role perfectly, he is arrogant but so intelligent, you can tell he is the smartest person in the room and this is amazing to see. Murphy shows different sides to this amazing person and this is a role of a lifetime for him and I am glad that we get the chance to see it.Supporting Characters
Emily Blunt plays his wife Kitty Oppenheimer and she is great in this role. She has one scene in particular where she owns the screen and makes you watch and pay attention to her. She is a strong character and the chemistry between her and Murphy is really good.Matt Damon plays General Leslie Groves and I really liked his character. You see the difference between himself and Oppenheimer but also that given everything that is required that they can work together. He oozed charisma and added some bit of humour which just made this film even better.It is great seeing Robert Downey Jnr in a film that isn't made by Marvel Studios and I swear he is also going to be up for an Oscar nomination for his role as Lewis Strauss. He is in a unique part of the film but delivers a masterful performance and sees how his character is affected by the actions of other characters and how he is losing grip on his lifestyle.Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock is a smaller role in the film but also a really effective role. She is a strong part of the film and I thought she was pretty powerful in all the scenes that she is in and this is another really solid performance for her young career.This film is full of well known actors in smaller roles with my favourites being Jason Clark, Josh Hartnett & Alden Ehrenreich who do really great jobs and maximise the ability with the small amount of minutes that they get.Story
The story is fascinating, it examines different times of Oppenheimers life and how it affects not just himself but the other people around him. There is a lot going on here and the film doesn't really hold back on trying to tell you as much as possible but it really works because of how the story is moulded and performed. I knew very little about Oppenheimer before the film but I am now super interested about him and the life that he led.Script
This film is expertly written. It is very serious due to the subject matter and it doesn't dumb the film down and shows us all the science that is involved in the film. The film has slithers of dark humour in this as well, especially through Damon's performance and that really balances the film well and kept me engaged.Style
The film looks incredible. The cinematography and showing how the bomb can truly affect anything is mesmerising. Christopher Nolan has become such a pivotal and amazing director that the way he makes this film feels like a crucial part of the film. The score by Ludwig Goransson is incredible and adds so much to every scene making it feel like this who amazing experience. The film may be 3 hours but I was never bored here and I thought every scene added something to the film and that is as great as it is.Overall
Overall, Oppenheimer is one of the best films of the year and will be truly remembered. We have been treated to a true cinematic experience and should be experienced on the big screen and I hope people see this film because of the hard work put in by everybody involved.Rating - 10/10.",10,Oppenheimer

"I feel as though I've grown up with Christopher Nolan as a fan of the movies. 'Inception' and 'The Dark Knight' left me exhilarated upon leaving the theatre and I haven't missed a Nolan film since. He raises passions to a boiling point though and sometimes I just don't feel like using the energy trying to engage with his films. That being said 'Oppenheimer' is a return to form and a film I want to praise loudly. I think it is a distillation of what people have liked about Nolan in the past for while offering his most mature dissection of character to date. I don't think 'Oppenheimer' will convert people but it is filled with surprises we don't expect.'Oppenheimer' is entirely built around the buildup to that fateful test and it plays you like a fiddle. The final countdown towards Trinity is one of the most harrowing half hours of film I've experienced with an audience. And it is a slower burn than you'd expect because in the long run 'Oppenheimer' isn't large in scope or scale aside from the moment with the bomb. It's really a costume drama. Who deserves the credit here? Honestly, the marriage of Cillian Murphy and the script is 'Oppenheimer's greatest achievement aside from the visuals. You'd expect Oppenheimer to rhapsodize endlessly but the script is intelligent enough to wait to explore that. Murphy plays Oppenheimer as intelligent but unaware of the implications of looking at the consequences of his actions. There's a motif that keeps repeating about theory vs practice and all along our characters convince themselves that the terrible things they are going to do are necessary until it is too late. The denouement isn't as dramatically compelling but it is essential to the story. This is where the film asks the most of Murphy who loses his intellectual bearing and charisma. Murphy is going to be the odds on favorite at the upcoming Academy Awards and with good reason.A common point of debate I've seen about Nolan is whether or not his films cross into fantasies about right wing strongmen. Frankly, I don't see it even in 'The Dark Knight' where you could most logically make that argument. 'Oppenheimer' puts that complaint to bed for me. The only emotion I felt it invoked was fear. This plays like a taut psychological horror film in areas. America isn't shown to be a good to an evil and Oppenheimer being forced to reconcile with that is one of the films strongest dramatic beats. The ending is probably the vaguest Nolan has ever offered. Oppenheimer achieves a vindication of sorts through the course of the film but it doesn't add up to much in the face of what he has unleashed. Who cares if his intentions were pure? My one complaint about the film and I feel it must be said is that I think there needed to be shown the effects of the bomb on the body and with real photos from Japan in 1945. There is a moment where Oppenheimer is watching a slide show and we see the reaction on his face. The audience needed to be confronted directly.'Oppenheimer' is Nolan at his best. I don't know what will come next but I won't take for granted that we get big spectacles with this caliber of maturity and complexity.",10,Oppenheimer
"Upon viewing Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, the following words come to mind.Riveting. Stirring. Engrossing. Horrifying. Haunting.This 3-hour epic is undoubtedly Nolan's magnum opus, his masterpiece.Every performance is simply perfect.Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer shows his transformation from wonder, to pride, to apprehension, to shock, to overwhelming regret in such a nuanced, emotive way that it guarantees him an Oscar nomination (I hope he wins it).As Strauss, the man who ultimately tries to take Oppenheimer down, Robert Downey Jr. Gives THE performance of his career. It is a stunning portrayal of a man who uses his political muscle to shame and scour the career and reputation of a man he feels slighted him at an event once. Particularly in today's political climate, the implications of his machinations to destroy Oppenheimer based on such a slight are intensely real. I wish I could say his actions are shocking, but those of us who remain politically aware will be far from shocked.The two powerful female performances of the film belong to Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh, playing Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively.Florence Pugh gets her chance to shine, particularly in what amounts to the most explicit sex scene in Nolan's ouevre, a scene filmed in such a matter-of-fact way that the explicitness of it is entirely beside the point. I wish we'd had the chance to get to know her character better, but in a film packed with so much to get through in 3 hours, it's understandable that her part of the story has to end relatively early, and her presence is far from forgotten by the end.Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer grows immensely in the third act, as she is the only voice in the room begging her husband to ""fight back, for God's sake."" She becomes the voice of the audience, growing increasingly impatient with Oppenheimer's willingness to martyr himself before a committee that is clearly intent on blaming everything that transpires on him.Matt Damon plays a small, but integral part that the Colonel-turned-General who brings Oppenheimer on to the Project in the first place. He also provides some much-needed humorous moments to the proceedings.This is a film that sticks in the mind. The implications of the conclusions reached here are chilling and all too important.If there was one element I'd change, it might be to put the big reveal of the test explosion at the very end of the film, rather than having it happen 2/3rds of the way through. That, however, is a minor gripe.This is a near-perfect film, one filled with dynamic performances and perfect technical elements, one whose message is deeply, thoughtfully felt, whose implications live on far beyond the viewing experience.This is beyond recommended. It is a must see.",10,Oppenheimer
"It's nearly impossible to put into words any kind of worthy analysis of Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer. This is the most mature story Nolan has ever taken on, which without a doubt will alienate some of the auteur's lesser educated fan base and leave them scratching their heads. I know that statement may come off as pompous, but it's true. This film will not impress EVERYBODY. However, for an intellectual, it is beautiful unbiased storytelling at its finest. In my personal opinion it's Christopher Nolan's best film to date.This film is DEEP. It's JACKED full of dialogue, but it's also great dialogue flawless in its delivery from a perfect and carefully constructed cast. The film is loaded with imagery and amazing cinematography that will no doubt keep your eyeballs stimulated. But what truly carries the film is how such an important and historically significant story is told through conversations that are truly compelling. You don't have to be a scientist or a politician to understand this movie. You just have to be interested in the subject matter. It's a film that asks a lot from its audience. Yes, Nolan masterfully SHOWS us what's happening, but you have to listen as well. You can't shy away from listening and rely on it's visuals... because you WILL get lost or dare I say bored. However, for an audience member with a higher attention span that's a good listener, get ready for a story that is so intellectually stimulating and also so horrifying that you will be left utterly speechless while viewing it. My father and I left the theater flabbergasted.The amount of hard work and dedication Christopher Nolan put into adapting the Pulitzer Prize winning biographical book American Prometheus trumps any piece of writing Nolan has done beforehand. I have not read this book, and now I know I MUST read this source material.You will just have to see this movie, because you don't want to hear the plot from me. Just see it. I will say this though. This isn't just a film about making the bomb then dropping it. It's about one man's life and legacy and SO MUCH MORE. This is not your typical Christopher Nolan film. If the film doesn't win best picture... I'd be shocked.Notable highlights for me:Everyone talks about Robert Downey Jr. In this film, and don't get me wrong, he is fantastic in the movie... but Matt Damon was really great. His role may not have been as big as Robert Downey Jr's, but every scene he was in just entertained the hell out of me. One in particular was when Oppy and Groves are trying to convince a scientist to join the Manhattan Project without telling them what it actually is that he's be joining really lets Damon shine and even offers some comic relief... but in the darkest way.The trinity test. Epic. What a sequence.The victory speech at Los Alamos. Wow. Horrifying. I want Nolan to make a horror movie after seeing that.Kitty, Oppenheimer's wife, sticking it to that SOB while being questioned at the hearing in that tiny room.The ending. Honestly, in my opinion one of the best endings in cinematic history that reveals so much truth. Now that's what you call a DOOZY. Damn.I highly recommend this film to an intellectual audience. You will not be disappointed.",10,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer is the latest film by Christopher Nolan about the legendary J. Robert Oppenheimer, father of the atomic bomb. Of all the films coming out this year, this was the one I was most hyped for by a wide margin. I've been hyped for this movie for a couple of years really. Mainly because it's by Christopher Nolan. I have to say, it was worth the wait and hype. I'd say this was Nolan's best film, at least since the Dark Knight.I have to say, the films he's done in the past decade plus have not been stellar. Don't get me wrong, Interstellar, Dunkirk, and Tenant are all fine enough, but they don't really measure up to his early work. Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and Inception I'd say are his golden years (the Prestige was good too). I'm glad to say that this film ranks up there with those films. In fact, Oppenheimer might be my favorite movie he's done. I have to think about that, but right now it's between this and The Dark Knight as his best for me.Like every Nolan production, the film looks and sounds stellar. The film is well-acted by everybody, especially Cillian Murphy. It's nice to see him finally getting a lead role in a Nolan production after being in so many of them already. Other standouts in the film are Robert Downey Jr. And Matt Damon. It's also nice to see Downey make a comeback after his last disaster of a film, Dolittle.If you're a major Nolan fan like me, you need to see this on the big screen if able. However, this is not a film for everyone. This is not a blockbuster crowd pleaser, but a long, somber character biopic, with some explicit sexual content thrown in. One scene in particular sex scene did feel a bit unnecessary. I understand what Nolan was going for, but it just felt bizarre and took me out of the rest of the scene a bit. But it was just one little moment. Hardly enough to ruin anything for me, but it might make some uncomfortable.",10,Oppenheimer
"Going into watching oppenheimer many people felt disappointed because of the court scenes. This is the story of OPPENHEIMER. Not the story behind the a bomb or the manhattan project. Yes that plays a huge part into the life and story of oppenheimer but so does everything that happened after which dramatically effected his life.Nolan takes this and makes it into the most interesting and most spectacle viewing experience i have had in a while in the theatre.The score ..... OMG this score is something other worldly, stands levels above that of inception and interstellar and that is a veryyyyy BIG STATEMENT TO MAKE. But there were times where i felt an atomic bomb to the chest. And having scenes where i was on my toes .Like i said its a masterpiece. Top 3 Nolan film .",10,Oppenheimer
"I would just like as an amateur to express my deepest sympathy for this movie, the purpose, the meaning, the goal and the courage to present complexity, politics and history to disinterested young people, wich unfortunately seem to go deeper and deeper to the futile ignorance of existing in comfort. This is a complex watch, does not align with modern culture and doesn't fear truth, it is not made for masses or public popularity.It is made primarily for the artist who makes it to people, so being him the first person to watch, it is made in the image of the artist himself not the people wich he will profit with.It is for people that seek the good old movie that grows their intellect and does not feed them with propaganda, yes I'm calling out for Barbie.Deeply grateful for this breath of fresh air in a saturated industry.",10,Oppenheimer
"Acting was about as perfect as you can get from the leads, directing was at times brilliant and other times superfluous, editing was timejumpy but made it compelling, seeing Einy was magical, ending was solid, writing was dialogue driven, the best scene was addressing the audience after the event.This is Nolan's most realistic movie, and it is pure Oscar bait. It has a real shot at winning him Best Picture, which would be shocking with the way he's been mostly unaccepted when it comes to awards season.However, as much as I thought it was a very good watch, brilliant at times, a good movie, and interesting, I also felt like it was a little bit too long and focused a little bit too much time on Strauss, when it could have been wrestling with Oppenheimer's moral dilemma or contained a shocking twist of some kind, even if it meant using creative liberties and stretching or embellishing the truth.The Strauss twist just didn't land emotionally or powerfully for the script, even though it was true. And therein lies the biggest weakness of the film- because it's a true story, it plays out like a documentary with little cinematic umph at its climactic moments, but Nolan does better than anyone else could've done with the material to turn it into compelling cinema.Technically, it's great-10/10, but experientially, it lands a little shy from being a true classic. However, I prefer this kind of grounded Nolan like with Memento and The Dark Knight than his overly ambitious sci fi thrillers because they are more relatable to real life. This is one of those one-watch technical gems that get high ratings, but most people would probably never sit through again unless it was for a school history class.7.5/10.",7,Oppenheimer
"All These great work by nolan in the past..The casting was great but the screen play was too dry..I literally feel asleep in the 2nd half. Never ever in my life felt asleep in theatre..It should he considered as a documentary of robert j oppenheimer..It's not an movie.The poster is too good for what i saw on screen..
There is drama but everything is just vocal..It didn't connect me as an audience .. It just keeps on going and going. The scene didn't evoke any emotional reaction.I went to see it with such high hope. It just felt like cheated to me as an nolan fan .This surely is over hyped and over rated.",4,Oppenheimer
"Beautiful, spectacular, tense, emotional, even better than I expected.. probably one of the best and most accurate docu-drama-movies ever.Cinematography 10/10
Sound 10/10
Script 10/10
Acting 10/10
Costume 10/10
So happy the director didn't ruin it with over CGI and overly fake graphics. The sound effects and sound editing were spectacular. Wish I watched this in IMAX tbh. The acting is excellent. 'Iron man Stark' didn't play his same boring role and actually played a real drama actor for once. There were alot tense moments. Not a dull moment... I can see the controversy over the reading of the Hindu holy book in a scene but none of my hindu friends were angry..they just said the timing of it could have been more appropriate (ie not while in bed).The movie overall was powerful...almost Dark Knight meets Einstein meets Nuclear weapon meets Hiroshima all in one. The movie was not filled with over-woke agenda, the movie just tried to tell it like it was Oppenheimer was definitely not a Communist spy and he was just another victim of the evil McCarthyism. The movie also dumbed down explaining atomic fusion in a way where it was not stupid but rather just simplified...ie it gave the 30 second elevator pitch as to what is an atom bomb. It wasn't insulting to intelligence as alot new Hollywood movies are nowadays. Movies nowadays are so dumbed down by Hollywood but not this one.I might actually watch this movie again, which shows how good and enjoyable it was. It really showed how they tormented Oppenheimer and how extremely intelligent he was. Highly recommended to watch this.",10,Oppenheimer
"This movie touched every base and was very well written. It answered so many questions I've had even after visiting the museum several times and with my husband working for the labs himself, I'm even more proud and astonished at all of the history Los Alamos has given. Very interesting, brilliant and sad.The acting was so good. They had film tents set up in the center of town and no way did I think the graphics like the house or buildings would look so much like the 40's.Much effort and thought was put into this film and it's honestly refreshing to see a good movie.10/10 would own on dvd and would watch again!",10,Oppenheimer
"Christopher Nolan is a director admired by many for his several pieces of cinematic art. His films ensure epicness, diversity, depth, and a cinematic experience unlike any other. His perception of filmmaking is the very reason he's admired as one of the most superb directors of our time. His movies are nothing short of masterpieces and Oppenheimer is no exception. His movies being newer than the majority of films by other directors also admired for their brilliant minds within and even outside the realm of filmmaking.His movies tend to have a modernized feel. And Oppenheimer is no different, it's fresh, modern with a sad, gritty tone while still having cinematography that makes it vibrant and artistic. At this moment in time, there is no better way to tell the story of Robert J. Oppenheimer ""the man that gave the world the power to destroy itself"". Perhaps if it were different it could be more pleasing. However, the difference would most likely be negligible as the story of the atomic bombs father is told beautifully. The film is a visually stunning, 3-hour-long biopic doing an impeccable job of showing Oppenheimer's pov. Especially emotionally. The film is a sort of 1st person piece of cinematic brilliance hyper-focused on Oppenheimer. An absolute blast, literally and figuratively, this movie is the bomb ""pun intended""I don't like rating films, as you can't help but compare them to others. Moreover, every film is different and most try to be different even if inspiration is taken. However, films are just films at the end of the day be it a humble fun one or a cinematic achievement and a true masterpiece by Nolan that makes you feel a sensation that you would never imagine was possible with a film if it wasn't for Nolan. However, films are easy to just throw a rating at so.....OPPENHEIMER by CHRISTOPHER NOLAN (10/10.",9,Oppenheimer
"I love history, especially period pieces, so I was drawn to ""Oppenheimer"" from the get-go. But sometimes period pieces will insert too much modernity into the visuals and dialogue, but Christopher Nolan stayed true to the period. ""Oppenheimer"" is as close to a true undeniable masterpiece as I've seen in a film in years. It is a symphony of powerful performances (Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer is brilliant, and his name had better be in many award season nominations), Emily Blunt and Matt Damon were amazing and Christopher Nolan weaved a profound film that went beneath J. Robert Oppenheimer being the ""Father of the Atomic Bomb"". He humanized him and showed us all of his triumphs, insecurities, tragedies, fears and flaws.""Oppenheimer"" is a sublime, haunting and mesmerizing film that makes you think. It stays extremely close to historical fact, and examines the gulf between empathy and compassion as it pertains to science and whether your allegience to your country should ever be stronger than when your conscience and moral compass is telling you what you're doing for your country is intrinsically wrong. And when you choose country over morality, what is the cost? Oppenheimer paid one helluva price for giving Truman and his country something that was truly a weapon of mass destruction. Now, there are bombs 10 times more destructive and deadlier than the Atomic Bomb, and unfortunately, Oppenheimer opened that Pandora's Box and there is no way of ever closing that lid again.Jumping between that Kangaroo Court grilling Oppenheimer withstood because, as we all know, the government will giveth, and it will taketh away if a person doesn't tow the line, to how he came to be the head of the Trinity Project, his personal failings and to the ultimate testing of the Atomic Bomb, was acted and shot amazingly. I don't normally like a lot of time jumps, but this was needed in order to figure out his journey, and to get a glimpse of the man behind the bomb. From the first frame, it draws you into the long-hidden world of J. Robert Oppenheimer.But ultimately what Christoper Nolan showed us is that the true monster in this film was not Oppenheimer's invention, but the insatiable appetite for power, and knowing what kind of destruction the bomb unleashed upon humankind. That realization plays out in Oppenheimer's pained and haunted face all thoughout the entire film.I was transfixed throughout this 3-hour magnum opus of incredible storytelling, cinematography, set design, acting and directing. This is a film that MUST be seen on the big screen to embrace the greatness and enormity of it.",10,Oppenheimer
"Does the end justify the means?Christopher Nolan's latest film tells a story divided into 3 parts: a geopolitical conflict, the making of the atomic bomb and Oppenheimer vs Lewis Strauss.It's a biographical film, so obviously it's not going to appeal to everyone.Oppenheimer is an intense film, but only for the first two hours; the last act is not as good from an editing point of view, which can be seen as clumsy or destabilizing, but it's an interesting film nonetheless.The film's direction and cinematography are also magnificent. The same can be said of the soundtrack: Hans Zimmer has composed a masterpiece.However, the pace is unbearable: apart from the bomb test scene, where the tension is perfectly set up, the film is rather slow, stretching itself out unnecessarily, not to mention the moral of : ""What? My bomb kills people?!!"" we hear over and over again in the final act.Still, it's good entertainment for movie fans, but it's aimed at a very specific audience that doesn't deserve as much attention.",8,Oppenheimer
"A cinematic spectacle. Oppenheimer is yet another masterclass filmmaking and storytelling from non other than, Christopher Nolan and he has crafted one of the greatest biopics of all time.In his own words, ""J. Robert Oppenheimer, the most important person who ever lived"". This film has exceptional storytelling and mad genius cinematography. Christopher Nolan is a very intelligent person himself, he has proven it since his first film, Following and have given such thought-provoking films like Memento, The Prestige, The Dark Knight, Inception, Interstellar and Tenet. With this, Nolan has proven to be a master at filmmaking taking inspiration from the 2005 book, American Prometheus.This film fires dialogue packed with historical information at a relentless pace and jumps to various times in Oppenheimer's life continuously (from his own perspective as well as Lewis Strauss' perspective) throughout it's 3 hour runtime. The star-studded cast gives phenomenal performance, even a small role has been done by the big name in Hollywood; this proves how big of a name is Nolan and how actors would do anything to work with him.The career best performance from Cillian Murphy must be the highlight of the film but I was really surprised with the final act and how important of a role is of Mr. Downey Jr. The final hour of the film must be the most intense in the film about the atomic bomb. As it unravels, my heart was pounding out of my chest!Aesthetically beautiful cinematography, exceptional performance and terrifying soundtracks.I was stunned looking at the visuals. A great milestone for film industry, as a whole. This film will be remembered throughout, at least for it's visual milestone.",10,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer is something else entirely and what makes it so fascinating is that it's so hard to distinguish what it really is. Christopher Nolan's latest and greatest masterwork is a cinematic achievement of blinding brilliance. Achieving a sublime combination of visual grandeur, technical flair, emotional intimacy and an examination of the limits of human endeavour and ambition. The tour-de-force performances are matched only by its ear-blistering musical soundscape by Ludwig Göransson, Oppenheimer is a destructive force to be reckoned with, although I'm still peeved Universal didn't let Nolan detonate an actual nuclear bomb for Trinty.",10,Oppenheimer
This movie was a pure display of art. Every scene was extremely impactful and suspenseful. It was a long movie but you were intensely driven in the whole time. Cillian Murphy truly captured the character and showing the human side/ moral dilemmas of a man that believe that he gave the world the power to destroy itself was amazing. It showed showed a very real and what felt like very true side to a life alter event that happened in your history and you could feel every bit of that impact in the audience as these decisions were being made. The acting was great for all characters and the ability to give what felt like back stage passes to one of the biggest events in the past century was amazing. It puts very recent events and current events in perspective and gives the audience a lot to talk about and discuss. Well done.,10,Oppenheimer
"The acting is incredible, it's an A list cast and man do they deliver. The sets, production quality and period accuracy is astonishing. There's a problem though. I felt like they made a superb 3 hour film, chopped it into 100 parts, and then stuck them all back together again at random.It would have been far better if they had made a more conventional chronological biopic. Instead it leaps about through time and styles, with elements of fantasy thrown in too for good measure. For much of the film I was just confused. ""What's happening and when?"" Was my main question throughout the film. Just as I picked up a clue what was going on it jumped to another time frame.Overall a bit too much style over substance. Only one person to blame for that.",6,Oppenheimer
"Given a pan of spagetti, you can cook it in different ways, boil it, BBQ it, steam it, anyway you want, but it won't turn out more. You can also cut it to make more pieces, but you still cannot make more out of it.Same for the movie. I don't know why it is rated this high.1. Funny cutting that constantly switches between timelines. And once you think it through you will find it unncessary and too showy.2. Too much conversation happening in short durations in different timelines. Confuses people and hardly get to the point.3. Too many characters popping out in short duration that you cannot even name them when the film is finally finished. Audiences are just struggling with how one character related to another.4. Nolan, starting from TENET, is heading to a strange direction that he makes film not for the audience but for gimmicks.Surely and admittedly, the casting is perfect, acting is perfect, filiming is perfect, everything is perfect except how the story is told, the core of the film, is just oridinary and intentionally scattered all over the place during the 3hrs duration of the movie.You can say that my taste of movie is not good, but I bet you most people walking out of the cinema are just as confused as me because they are already forgetting what happened in the first hour when those last few scenes are coming. Then, when they are home, when they click a youtube video explaining what on earth actually happened, they will just find out: ok, this Nolan guy is just making things complicated because he wants to make things complicated.Will people get Oscar because of this film? Yes, I think so. But, this does not make it any more better than a intentionally complicated film. I just hope more people that watched the movie can be brave enough to write down their actual feelings. I originally rated 5, but after seeing those 10/10 reviews, it is 3 now. I cannot get through why people are praising its weaknesses over and over again. It's Nolan, so what? If a film cannot get to general audience, how can it be the 'best' film?",3,Oppenheimer
"I was very excited to watch Oppenheimer for a long time and it didn't disappoint. It's very interesting and overwhelming film from the start to the end I enjoyed every single second of it and all the details, and I really liked the acting of the characters like Murphy and Robert Downey, Jr. And it is in my top 10 or actually my top five favorite movies of all time the storyline was amazing and everything connected very well. It seems like a story, and I know it's based on a true story. It was very, very good. I thetic of the film was very old money, and I didn't know how to explain it, but it was very luxury in a way that I like it, and the science was like another story like it was very interesting, and the quantum physics and theories was very interesting, and how Oppenheimer was feeling guilty about his own doing, and everything makes sense and they just got the feeling that they got in interstellar that's all top five favorite movies of all time.",10,Oppenheimer
"Finally caught the biggest film of the year-Oppenheimer, at the big screen. Christopher Nolan grand biographical, as we all know is about the genius of the same name, and who was instrumental in creating the first nuclear weapons. The film is all about Oppenheimer leading the Manhattan Project under General Groves and in collaboration with a number of great scientists, physicists and others. We might have read/ watched a lot about the bombing of Hiroshima/ Nagasaki, but not many are aware about Oppenheimer's credit and what followed aftermath. Christopher Nolan is a legend of modern-day cinema, and this film only cements his reputation further. He took the basic story of a genius, but layered it with his humane side, his weaknesses, his inner voice in backdrop of world at war, communism, and modern history. The film has parallel tracks of the past and present and they create magic on screen. The enquiry scenes are intriguing and the actual testing scenes are thrilling. The film has great performances, and Cillian Murphy walks tall in the title role. It also has great cameos of other great scientists/physicists/professors of that era-Niels Bohr, Edward teller but it is the scenes featuring Albert Einstein which leaves maximum impact. An awesome film in all departments of storytelling and technicalities, this one is one of the best films to come out of Hollywood in recent years, wherein more focus had been on Marvel kind cinema. The film is heavy on dialogues and uses lot of technical and political terms so is a serious watch without light scenes. Inspite of that and the complex topic if people from all over are loving the film, then it is triumph of Nolan, the team and Oppenheimer himself!",9,Oppenheimer
"I thoroughly enjoyed this breathtaking political thriller (which, in my opinion, is mistakenly marketed as psychological horror movie)! As a form, it is very close to Nolan's 'The Prestige.' The rivalry gradually unfolds, and at the end, we get the whole picture. Best suited for those who have some interest and understanding of the development of Physics during World War II and the political scenario of America at that time. And if you are a lover of good old style drama and Christopher Nolan's work, I think that three hours runtime is not too long for a story of this scale! The story material has potential for a mini-series as well.",10,Oppenheimer
"In the realm of filmmaking history, ""Oppenheimer"" is an awe-inspiring and monumental achievement that captivates audiences from the very first moments. The movie delves into a chilling saga of the enduring impact of politics, which can surpass even the horrors of atomic bombings. Director Christopher Nolan, widely known as Chris, masterfully weaves together a complex and thought-provoking story that unfolds through multiple timelines, rendering seemingly ordinary moments into revolutionary conversations - a signature trait that is uniquely Nolan.Beyond its exceptional visual splendor, the film's narrative is a testament to Nolan's unparalleled storytelling prowess, culminating in a true fusion of his distinct styles. Much like his previous works, ""Oppenheimer"" exhibits a grandeur reminiscent of ""Interstellar"" and ""Inception,"" as it ingeniously manipulates time akin to ""Dunkirk"" and ""Memento,"" while also embracing a dramatic intensity reminiscent of ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Prestige."" The emotional depth woven into the heart of the narrative sets it apart from any other cinematic creation, making it truly one of a kind.The performances in ""Oppenheimer"" are nothing short of extraordinary. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of a tormented character is a revelation, making him a strong contender for a Best Actor Oscar. His performance is genuine and authentic, devoid of any theatricality that might cheapen the experience, unlike Rami Malek's portrayal of Freddy Mercury in another film. Robert Downey Jr. Also shines in his role, showcasing the full range of his acting abilities despite having limited screen time. Meanwhile, Matt Damon and Emily Blunt both deliver exceptional performances, contributing significantly to the movie's excellence. Not a single actor misses the mark in this ensemble cast, including Alden Ehrenreich, Kenneth Branagh, Florence Pugh, and the previously mentioned Rami Malek.In simple terms, ""Oppenheimer"" is a grand and thought-provoking cinematic experience, easily deserving the title of the best movie of the year so far. The film immerses its audience in a world that effortlessly balances the breathtaking visual spectacle with an engaging and multi-layered narrative. Nolan's brilliance in storytelling reaches new heights, and the performances from the cast elevate the film to an unparalleled level of excellence. Such an exceptional work of art should undoubtedly receive recognition in multiple Oscar categories, from the talented supporting cast and lead actors to the behind-the-scenes key players such as the music composer, VFX team, costume designers, editors, and cinematographers.As the movie leaves viewers spellbound and still processing its impact, it is no wonder that many rush to secure tickets for repeat viewings. ""Oppenheimer"" is a golden standard in modern filmmaking, leaving an indelible mark on cinema history and ensuring its place among the all-time greats. For those fortunate enough to experience it on an IMAX screen, it's worth heeding the playful warning to ""keep your wits about you"" and safeguard personal space to fully savor the immersive experience.",10,Oppenheimer
"I don't believe any film can be a 10 no film is perfect but this film is very close. All the acting is amazing, Cillian Murphy tells a whole story with his eyes giving one of the best solo performances in cinema history , Robert Downey jr really amazed me, I was not expecting his performance to be as good as it was, an Oscar for both of them. Also, not talked enough about whenever this film is mentioned, is how good and believable Matt Damon is as Leslie groves. The cinematography is amazing - I really suggest watching it in imax to get the full experience. The use of music is brilliant. I was hooked from start to finish Nolan's best.",10,Oppenheimer
"It has barely been 30 minutes since Ive seen this Masterpiece in the theater (IMAX of course) and am still trying to process it.The mere storytelling of this 3 hour long movie was masterful. The storybeats take the viewer on a rollercoaster of emotion, something of which I cannot even begin to comprehend or express. The character work of each of the actors was perfection, with smaller cameos from actors I would have not at all expected to see but was very glad to see them when they showed up on screen.I would highly recommend seeing this movie in IMAX. The bomb itself amongst the fantastic soundtrack and sound direction left the theatre shaking.You have to see this movie in the theatre to truly appreciate and fully understand what I mean; it was something special.If I had to pick 1 word to describe this experience, it would be 'Phenomenal'.Highly Recommend. Christopher Nolan and his team have have only gotten better. The craft of Cinema is truly in good hands.",10,Oppenheimer
"After having a fun time at Hoyts Cinemas with my Dad here's my spoiler-free review of Oppenheimer! As usual, I'll be talking about my thoughts, my favourite moments of watching this movie & my conclusion/rating! Christopher Nolan is back with his latest instalment after the mixed reviews of Tenet and you know what? It's better than that! Cillian Murphy looks older than he does in the director's previous films he's starred in! The rest of the cast is great too, Robert Downey Jr. Is such a talented actor since he is Iron Man and I've only seen the first Sherlock Holmes movie but I'll watch A Game of Shadows before the third one arrives (If it comes out). Along with brilliant performances by Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt (who used an American accent which was weird cuz she's British IRL), Oscar winners; Rami Malek & Gary Oldman (who I didn't recognize while watching it). It was 3 hours long, I was careful not to drink too much water (just like Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One), I fell asleep in bits of it and I stayed awake for the rest of it which was funny! Overall this is not only better than Christopher Nolan's last blockbuster but also Barbie which I won't watch! That's why I'm giving this an 8/10! I look forward to watching movies at home while I wait for Kraven The Hunter to release in October! ;-)",8,Oppenheimer
"Christopher Nolan's movies are among the best ever made, be it his Dark Knight Trilogy, gritty and trope-challenging crime operas that happen to have superheroes in them, or his science-fiction movies like Inception and Interstellar, which are though-provoking, yet still with the required amusement factor for the blockbuster audience. His last sci-fi movie, Tenet, was as high concept as ever, but also complex to a fault, and somewhat lacking a heart to win over the big crowds. But even though every movie that Nolan makes is big, he tends to alternate between something more mainstream (for lack of a better term) and something that feels a bit smaller and more personal. And though it tackles big themes, few of his movies feel so personal as Oppenheimer.In the beginning, it may feel a bit confusing why Nolan keeps moving back and forth in time, but as soon as we are pulled into the narrative, it becomes clear that the emotional core is formed by Dr. Robert Oppenheimer being interrogated in a private hearing. It is the scaffolding for a series of flashbacks that illustrate the topics that are being discussed, from the doctor's beginnings as a promising but clumsy student, to the man who saved America, to an enemy of the state who had to be silenced for not walking in sync with the political climate at the time. At the surface, the movie is a re-telling of a decisive moment in human history, and it is easy to see why the parallels with today's situation makes it such a suitable subject: the ease with which allies can change into enemies; governments eagerly exploiting those with opposite ideas when they are needed, but disposing of them when they stop being useful; and people getting cancelled by labeling their views too liberal or socialist.On another level, Oppenheimer is also a biopic of a man who is brilliant yet also flawed, with many talents and an almost annoying lack of vanity. Apart from his brilliance, his biggest talent is eschewing his own ego by bringing other great minds together on the Manhattan project. He is also a womaniser who has trouble being a family man and a faithful husband, is sometimes too honest, and can step on the wrong toes, like those of his counterpart, Senator Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). Cillian Murphy, Nolan's secret weapon in their sixth collaboration, is great as the man who understands the necessity of what he is inventing, yet is also realistic enough to know where he should stop. None of his shortcomings makes him in any way bad or unqualified, but those are grounds to be silenced even today, especially if one's political views can be easily taken out of context.Nolan skillfully films Oppenheimer's narrative in color, and switches to black-and-white when showing Strauss' side. Which brings us to the third layer within the movie, as a carefully crafted morality tale. For a seemingly simple story about a country at war with ruthless enemies, and scientists being asked to help invent a solution, the film shows that the science and decision-making was not driven by intellect, but more often than not frought with human shortcomings such as pride, resentment, egoism, desires and revulsion. The great thing is that both sides of the drama get ample time and exposure, so that we see why these people do what they did, with the judgment left to the viewer. We are drawn into the movie so well that we can emotionally understand that no one at the time knew the outcome of the morel dilemma, so basically no one's actions were clearly wrong or right; it is only in hindsight that our minds can decide that.In selling the drama, it certainly helps that everyone wants to work with Nolan: even the smallest parts are filled with great artists, from Florence Pugh as the strong-willed mistress, David Krumholz as a scientist with a clear moral compass, to Downey Jr. As an unforgettable two-faced politician, an achievement that should get him Oscar gold.A movie with so many perspectives, topics and timeframes could have easily become a top-heavy mess, and some sides could have been underplayed, but due to a great script, clear direction and skillfull editing, we never get lost in one big jumble of timelines and characters. The makers thoroughly manage to turn it into a great thriller drama in which all the pieces fall into place until the final shot, while still keeping the audience intellectually engaged, captivated and amused throughout the entire 3-hr runtime. And that work of precision may be the biggest achievement of all. Please bring out the Oscars!",10,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer tells the story of Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy), creator of the Atomic bomb and the role he played in WWII. Whilst I wasn't familiar with his backstory, I had to jump on the bandwagon and see what all the fuss was about.Cast wise, it was packed! However maybe too star-studded to the point where I found myself questioning why certain big-name actors were involved in the film given how little screen time they had. Florence Pugh's character was unnecessary, and whilst she may have meant a lot to Oppenheimer, they could have just referenced her instead. Whilst I personally found Cillian Murphy to be emotionless and monotone, I'm not familiar enough with the real life Oppenheimer to know if that was accurate or not.Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr. Have strong performances, and Josh Hartnett deserves a special mention for not aging a day since 1998.It's a long film, and there was a lot of dialogue. During some scenes, I felt like I was in a science lecture and had to try not to doze off, and as for the timeline, it was a bit confusing with black-and-white scenes and coloured ones representing various times that didn't make sense.There's no doubting that this film is great, however I just don't think I'm the type of person who would appreciate it in its finest.",6,Oppenheimer
"Nolan is gifted at writing in such a way that characters say much yet in fact say nothing. Nolan's addicted to showing the story out of sequence, and sometimes it works, but it's just overkill now. Thank God for Mr. Nolan, because without his genius we wouldn't know the limits of our eardrums.It would have been nice if this movie actually explained how a nuclear fission bomb works. Maybe explain some of the differences in plutonium and uranium bombs. Maybe something about the Demon Core?No Japanese in sight. Not a single photograph. Where's Ken Watanabe when you need him? I though he and Nolan were homies...
I guess when you're making a film about a man who was (to a very significant extent) responsible for the death of over a hundred thousand Japanese, you want to do your best to not show a single one of them. There was a scene with slides of the wreckage of Hiroshima and Nagasaki but we didn't get to see a singe picture, not one. I guess it's too horrific. Instead we get some unnecessary tits and sex.It was also strange that the most iconic speech that Oppenheimer made is only alluded to twice.3 hours of my life I can never get back.3 stars; one for the costumers, one for the lighting and one for Cillian Murphy.",3,Oppenheimer
"I originally gave this a 9 because I struggle to give something a 10 but I honestly can't think of a single thing that could be improved or done better. The casting, the editing, the acting, the sound, the pacing... I can't think of a single thing wrong with any of these.For anyone who is put off by the runtime, I watched Indiana Jones a week prior to seeing Oppenheimer and although Oppenheimer is just a little bit longer, Indiana Jones was an absolute endurance test to sit through, in comparison. Every second of Oppenheimer feels pivotal to the experience and I almost wasn't ready for it to end.I don't want to say too much because a million other reviews have said it many times over but this is absolutely one of the most incredible film experiences you could ever hope to have and gives me huge faith that real film making isn't dead.",10,Oppenheimer
"The pit in your stomach deepens as every layer of this 3-hour experience unravels, revealing what could possibly be the most thought provoking film up to date. There's a level of excellence that is broken down to various elements that complement one another in ways that I could never predetermine. From a shuddering score by Ludwig Göransson, to the distinctively believable cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema, the rattling sound design, the massive and completely grounded cast, and most importantly a story that speaks for itself with the emotions that overwhelm you as you leave the theater. Christopher Nolan never underestimates the intelligence and grasp that humans have while watching his films and he follows that same pattern in his 12th installment by introducing details that seem ambiguous at a first glance until they slowly formulate the defining moments to conclude this film. Cillian Murphy is disciplined in every mannerism that he physically expresses along with every bit of anxiety that he attempts to keep in. Another chapter to mark a defining moment in Nolan's career and hopefully one that will receive its worthy credit.",10,Oppenheimer
"In the months leading up to Oppenheimer, two things were clear from the buzz surrounding it: Christopher Nolan doesn't mess around with digital effects, and its sequence of the Trinity bomb test -- where J. Robert Oppenheimer is indeed ""become Death, destroyer of worlds"" as the Bhagavad Gita passage goes -- was said to be the most powerful and devastating movie scene you'll ever see in a theater, IMAX or otherwise. Conclusion: It seemed likely that this will be the first film to kill its viewers with either fire or radiation poisoning. Tread carefully.In all seriousness, Oppenheimer delivered all that we were promised and then some, rocking me to the core and thence leaving my mind racing in a way that no film has for the past several years. Its success will solidify the revitalization of movie theaters -- Nolan has long been one of the strongest advocates of theaters over home streaming, even with his controversial release of Tenet during the pandemic -- and its quality will do the same for audiences, who can't hope for this kind of experience in the living room unless they have a damn fine set-up. Most importantly, it solidifies that real movies are back on top, as opposed to... well, you know.Based on 2005's The American Prometheus, the film follows the development of the WWII Manhattan Project through various perspectives, some ""subjective"" and some ""objective"", denoted by shifts to black-and-white: the scenes in color show the truth as Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy in a career-defining performance) sees it and are wholly dramatized; the B/W ones are based more on what's documented in literature and court transcripts. It's not entirely linear either, yet there's never any question as to where in the timeline we're at, or who's telling their version of that moment.The rest of the cast is quite considerable. Figures significant to the Manhattan Project, its judicial aftermath, Oppenheimer's personal life, or all three are played (brilliantly) by the likes of Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh (who shares Murphy's prestigious honor of being the first actors filmed naked on 70mm IMAX), Emily Blunt, Benny Safdie, Rami Malek, Kenneth Branagh, Jason Clarke, David Dastmalchian, and even Josh Peck if you can believe it. There are also actors that seem to have either been forgotten or laughed out of the movies that Nolan invites us to reconsider; Dane DeHaan, Josh Hartnett, and Alden Ehrenreich deliver some of the most memorable performances in the movie. Also look out for big names within the fields of math and physics -- quantum or otherwise (Oppenheimer meets with the likes of Heisenberg, Bohr, and even Einstein, with whom he shares some of his best scenes).The film has been rightly described as an intimate story about something massive. And in spite of its runtime and even its contents as such (it's a rather dialogue and character-oriented picture), it is a movie that feels energetic at every turn; through snappy editing and seminally used music and sound, Nolan has made a film whose talky, three-hour totality has the same intensity to it as the final act of any of his other productions. There are knowing glances and vital cutaways that will carry even greater weight on a second viewing.It knows precisely how much to show -- with regard to mass destruction -- and how much to leave to the imagination of its characters as well as us. One of the most striking moments is one in which a Republican statesman simply advises against dropping the Atomic Bomb on Kyoto. Why? Well, because he and his wife vacationed there one time.It's been pointed out that this quick exchange is far more effective a demonstration of the evil and callousness of American Imperialism than had they simply shown how the Japanese suffered as a result of the Hiroshima-Nagasaki strikes -- something that certain reviewers felt was ""missing"" here, but I'll get to that. (One notably funny complaint, however, came from Armond White, who of course thought Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was a better nuke movie and also brought back his ""Nolan's Joker caused the Aurora shooting"" spiel. My guy Armond is hilarious again; truly cinema is back.) Similarly, there's a scene of thunderous applause near the end -- shortly after JRO sees that he has made annihilation itself -- that has been described as ""scarier than any standard violent horror film"", and I tend to agree. Before the bomb itself is even detonated, Nolan manages to give it a most terrifying presence.Having said that, the primary reason to see this in a movie theater is, indeed, the Trinity launch. This sequence -- the heart-racing build-up, the detonation itself, and the tangible awe and despair that follows -- shook me in a way that art hasn't done since Vishnu knows when. I thought for a moment that critics might be exaggerating the impact and subsequent dread of this moment, but I am prepared to argue that it is a paragon of audiovisual art and what it can do for us if we dare let it. JRO has a series of visions -- hallucinations of splitting atoms, dying stars, and other images of annihilation that he alone can truly perceive/fathom -- that also justify seeing this film in the largest possible auditorium with the best possible sound system, but that one scene is reason enough.Regardless, the rest of Oppenheimer is very much a ""Christopher Nolan presentation"" -- it is weighty, technically precise, meticulously told, and powerfully scored by Ludwig Göransson -- but the subject matter and the occasional shifts to monochrome have yielded comparisons to the political epics of Oliver Stone. Nolan has long been among those rare filmmakers whose name is enough to draw a crowd, and now, in an age where the slop that used to dominate the rest of the summer movie season is starting to lose people, he gets to make his masterpiece -- and we all came to see it.This, therefore, isn't just the best film of the year; it's one of the most important of its era. To paraphrase Patrick Willems's Letterboxd review, it's very funny that this, of all things, is a big summer blockbuster. But also quite reassuring.",10,Oppenheimer
"I don't know how to put it into words but Nolan just delivered a
MONUMENTAL MASTERPIECE.Movie is not about the attacks on Hiroshima-Nagasaki, or the Bomb, it is all about the Character of Dr. J Robert Oppenheimer played by another genius Cillian Murphy. Oh man what dephths, Christopher brings into his characters, its extraordinary!""Amateurs chase the sun and get burned. Power stays in the Shadow!""- Robert Junior is killing it!!Being an oscar worthy film and with the whole cast, is fine and all, but this one is by far the most well written, flawless, or say its simply Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus!",10,Oppenheimer
Christopher Nolan never again disappoints me with all the films he made. But this one is the real deal. Give this man an award for best picture and best director and screenplay. Give Cillan Murphy an award for best actor in leading role. I saw give everyone that worked very hard well on this masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is all I can for everyone who is a big fan of Christopher Nolan films. The IMAX 70MM MUST SURVIVE AND PREVAIL. It is better to watch the film in the best IMAX 70MM FORMAT POSSIBLE. No one and I meant no has ever witnessed this film before.!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,Oppenheimer
"For the first time I watch a 3 hour's documentary without getting bored for a single minute. This movie is a must watch, The story is more than amazing and the cast got the job done. Outstanding performance from each actor on the movie.Christopher Nolan did all the things that make this movie be one of the top rated movies in all histories.Trust me on this that the income of this movie will cross the 500 Million.A must watch movie and I completely recommend it to anyone even if you don't like documentaries trust me that you will like this one and you will enjoy the 3 hours in it.Thank you guys for this Masterpiece.",10,Oppenheimer
"The story of Oppenheimer and the development of the A-bomb is wonderfully told by Nolan. Nolan uses his non-linear storytelling to great effect, and manages to juggle numerous aspects without getting confusing.What is unexpected is how little screen time is given to the bomb itself. In the hands of another director, there would be excessive scenes of explosions, mushroom clouds and people & buildings being vaporised. Nolan does none of this. The only explosion is the trinity test, and even that is done in a minimalistic way. The Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs are related by radio report and never shown. Even when footage of the aftermath is being shown we do not see it, but instead focus on the reactions of the viewers.What is on display here is the conflict between politics and science, the morality of the military application of science, and the naivete and short-sightedness of pretty much everyone involved in the project.Most importantly, this film does not pass judgement. The dilemma that tormented Oppenheimer is central to the character; he was neither hero nor villain, but a brilliant scientist who was greatly flawed as a human being. Did creating and using the bomb save lives or cost them? No one will ever know for sure. Is mankind capable of not destroying itself? The evidence is not promising. There are no easy answers, but the message that I came away with is this:
Those who have the power to change the world are burdened with the weight about whether they should or not.",9,Oppenheimer
"I don't really know how to describe a cinematic experience but I think Oppenheimer should be counted as one. You are absorbed into the story, and feel immersed into this world. The movie plays like a thriller slowly revealing new details. Nolan is a master of playing the story non-linearly, but the use of colors contrasting with black and white clearly distinguishes the timeline. We see the lead up to the building of the atomic bomb, and the aftermath. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer is just killing it (pun intended), needless to say. I see there is a solid casting and every supporting actor grabs your attention. Even Florence Pugh's small role in the movie is interesting. Emily Blunt's talent is not wasted even with the little screen time she is given. I can say every sensory experience you can get from a movie is fully exploited. The use of sound is very much part of the story, and keeps you feeling anxious throughout. You also feel Cillian's Oppenheimer. I mean Nolan literally bares his character just to show his state of mind and emotion. This is done in various scenes. I could feel the shock Oppenheimer felt when he was cheered on by crowds after learning of the deaths caused by his invention. Whatever emotional journey Oppenheimer is experiencing, I could feel it. I also like how the science is explained simply, and I could grasp the idea of how an atomic bomb works. It was great to see what physicists I had only heard of in name on screen such as Niels Borh, Heisenberg, and most importantly Einstein. It was like the Avengers of geeks, and three hours did not feel long. Robert Downey Jr was brilliant as Lewis Strauss, and I see he channeled a bit of Tony Stark too, but in the unlikable side. Matt Damon was great too, and I like his back and forth with Cillian Murphy. The best part is the explosion scene, and that is worth the wait. I could say they could have ended the movie shortly after the explosion though. Yet, the explosion scene was perfectly executed. It was tense, and showcases the most powerful and unnerving atomic explosion scene in cinema. Nolan perfectly shows how dangerous an atomic bomb is without showing any death, and the impact of it lingers even as the story continues after the explosion. I certainly believe that Oppenheimer will be one of the most important movies of the decade if not of all time. I may even watch it again on the big screen, and yes you do need to watch it on the big screen to fully enjoy it.",10,Oppenheimer
"The world has been waiting for a first class drama to help bring em back to the movies after a shortage of really fine movies for a really long time. I went in hoping that this was gonna be the cinematic miracle that Hollywood has been holding it's breath for. It wasn't. It was a modestly adequate film that I could have skipped. With a running time of close to three hours, this ponderous film just felt repetitive and quite tedious throughout. There's an all star cast that would have been better served by appearing in a movie that had been written and edited with more selectivity. Had I seen it on TV and it had been a half hour shorter, perhaps I'd have thought more of it.",6,Oppenheimer
"No human on the planet has a bigger cult of personality than Christopher Nolan. Not Trump, not Musk, not Messi, not Putin. No one.His fans see everything he has done as a masterpiece. It's not just that he can't do no wrong, but that he can't do no average.Yet that's exactly what this movie is. An average biopic.Advertised as a visual masterpiece, it actually makes no difference whether you watch it in IMAX or not. Facial close ups and office meetings make up for 90% of the movie. Few desert shots and a very, very brief explosion scene don't warrant the price. Nor the hype.Additionally, I'd say that the Terminator franchise presented the dangers of nuclear war far better and visually more stunning. Maybe even Stargate too.Everything presented can be expected, many common character clichés are present. The runtime is another decision driven by Nolan's ego. The score was clever at times.The spectacle is somewhat created by having a great actor fill every role, yet few are given any jobs that an average drama student couldn't fulfill.I enjoy Nolan's work, bar Tenet, which was at least ambitious. Yet Oppenheimer is just coasting on reputation.",5,Oppenheimer
"Resounding applause for such a well crafted movie. This might be Christopher Nolan's best entry yet. Snappy, well thought and energetic, Oppenheimer never lets its foot off the gas. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr are absolute juggernauts. You feel each cut, each stare, each word said.The stress expertly overwhelms the audience through insanely good edits and music. The sound design is exceptional. It just all feels so natural and earned. The tension is through the roof and you feel that with every nuance this film brings.Cillian's looks and expressions are just perfect. This guy brings his A Game like never before, same for Robert. The security clearance bit is gripping and intense. It's pretty shocking to be honest. The drama is real and the tone is adequately overbearing and gloomy.At the end of the film, you're just in awe. Truly a memorable experience and unforgettable achievement.",10,Oppenheimer
"Wow! The hype clip from earlier this year did this film no justice. Scene by scene, line by line you feel Oppenheimer's struggle and his shift in morality. This movie will be mentioned as an all time classic. A masterclass of film making as well as acting. Murphy, Blunt, Downey, & Damon all deserve merit, credit, and all the accolades for top their notch performances. Paced extremely well (a three hour experience) does not feel like three hours. Excellent audio and visuals throughout. There is nothing I can complain or criticize about this film. It's the perfect film. The Godfather level perfection. This should be a fixture at every IMAX theater in perpetuity. Go see it. If you have already seen it once, see it again.",10,Oppenheimer
"First off, please please go see and support this film!Oppenheimer tells the real life story of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the many intricacies of his life throughout university and then leading to his work on the Manhattan Project. I will tell you right off I left the theater in awe and, looking back on it now, a little disconcerted with the last few scenes of the film. (Once you see, you'll understand) Christopher Nolan has once again simply outdone himself with this film, he is my favorite filmmaker working today and seems to be one of the only filmmakers to be given the budget to make massive films like Oppenheimer, Interstellar, Inception, Tenet, Dunkirk, and so many more to support going to the movies.The film is, yes, three hours long and very dialogue heavy but this three hour film went by with the snap of a finger. Nolan does a brilliant job of accelerating the pace of the film and it sort of traps you and locks you in place. Throughout watching the film thirty minutes of it was just gone, like it had evaporated. Nolan does a brilliant job editing his films to where there is little to no fat left around the edges and no extra baggage, every scene has its place.You will definitely, and I for one, will have to watch this film more than once as there is just so much too unpack with this film. The star power in this film alone is tremendous, the score is mesmerizing, the visual effects fantastic, the performances are enthralling, and Chris Nolan is at the top of his game!This film should and will get a lot of love and praise come awards season. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Shine in this film and their performances are one of, if not the, best of their respective careers. Christopher Nolan deserves at least nominations for Best Director, Best Adapted or Original Screenplay, and Best Picture at the Oscars, and he should definitely win his first Oscar this awards season. While Cillian Murphy deserves at least a nomination for Best Actor and Robert Downey Jr. Deserves a nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars as well. Both of them could win both with these performances easily.A truly tremendous film and one that requires multiple viewings to be truly appreciated!",10,Oppenheimer
"When you see Oppenheimer, what catches your attention is how a three-hour film full of dialogue is so long and doesn't get boring. The wonderful Murphy plays the role of Oppenheimer, and the good thing about the film is that instead of being about the atomic bomb, it is about Oppenheimer himself.The film is able to portray the pressure and torment of conscience that Oppenheimer suffers after the bombing in Hiroshima and also raises a big question. Whether the things we got after the atomic bomb were worth it or not.I recommend to all cinema friends and fans of Nolan not to miss Nolan's three-hour masterpiece about the most important 4 lines in history.",10,Oppenheimer
"'Oppenheimer' is a uniquely intriguing cinematic experience. It feels strangely-miraculous the way Christopher Nolan was able to take-on such complicated and even controversial subject matter and transform it into an intensely absorbing narrative intricately spiced with spectacularly imaginative visuals. Based on the over 700 page award winning biography 'American Prometheus' by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin (which I have read multiple times-over, since it's 2005 publication). The story of how J. Robert Oppenheimer led the Manhattan Project to create the first atomic bombs (before the Axis powers could ever figure it out), later valiantly attempting to limit the probabilities of world-wide Earth-shattering nuclear holocaust.... eventually having his intimate family-life and professional reputation severely disrupted and indelibly injured by the torrent of irrational McCarthyist paranoia sweeping the early 1950's - makes for fascinating material indeed but also an extremely daunting endeavor to capture coherently & compellingly on film due to the sheer complexity of subject matter along with the perplexingly enigmatic nature of the man along with the cruelly-chaotic circumstances of his times. It most definitely feels like only a Top-tier exceedingly gifted writer/Director like Christopher Nolan possessed the artistic vision and innovative resourcefulness to truly bring 'Oppenheimer' to cinematic 'Life' (another critical-factor being Christopher Nolan's inspired choices for matching the very finest actors to their 'perfect' spot-on roles).Cillian Murphy especially projects the otherworldly-luminous intelligence of Oppenheimer and perhaps even more importantly transmits the disquieting feeling that 'Oppie' actually possessed the uncanny awareness (which eventually became disillusioning burden) that he was carrying the weight of the entire World on his shoulders trying to control unremitting nuclear proliferation - not always knowing how to effectively navigate the dark-matter realm of political persuasion. The key to Cillian's emotionally resonant performance is that he evokes tremendous poignancy, communicating agonizing internal-conflict and deep reflection even in the many moments when there is little to no dialog (often thru facial expression alone). Robert Downey Jr. Provides a masterclass thru his complex portrayal of Oppenheimer chief adversary Lewis Strauss - making Strauss a character harboring layers of resentment well-concealed, and it takes practically the entire movie before the audience becomes fully-aware of the manipulative nature of Struss's master-plan to bring Oppenheimer down a few notches.... things ironically come full circle for Strauss which brings a small bit of 'closure' towards finale but Downey Jr.'s performance is so subtle and multi-layered making the Strauss character always fascinating and extremely watchable every time he appears on screen.Emily Blunt is also extremely watchable as Kitty Oppenheimer, J. Robert's formerly 'radical' wife who was a tragic and tormented (and often alcoholic) figure in real life..... but Emily Blunt's portrayal goes a long-way toward 'humanizing' Kitty often showing how fiercely protective she was of J. Robert when the walls were closing in on him. I actually wish there were many more scenes with Kitty because it feels like she often gets 'short-shrift' in the many Oppenheimer biographies I have read, but Emily Blunt's intriguing and humane performance seems to shed new light on the authentic character of Kitty which is refreshing.Matt Damon is sufficiently 'commanding' as General Leslie Groves, the scenes between Groves and Oppenheimer are some of the best in the entire film. The real General Groves was quite a visionary (and somewhat of an authentic genius himself) for choosing Oppenheimer to lead the Manhattan Project in the first place (Groves intuitively understood that only Oppenheimer could effectively cultivate maximum cooperation & optimal creativity from all the eccentric scientific prodigies involved) Groves also fiercely stood by Oppenheimer thru the entire WWII years and it was really the Groves/Oppenheimer professional partnership that guaranteed America would be the first to Unlock and unleash atomic power - Matt Damon and Cillian Murphy authentically transmit this pragmatic professional bond perfectly!Another standout performance is Florence Pugh as un-reformed radical Jean Tatlock who might have been Oppenheimer's truest love but was also an extremely emotionally-fragile Soul who inadvertently brought indelible torment to J. Robert's life (and his relationship with Jean was probably one of the critical detrimental factors in the loss of Security-Clearance due to Jean's lingering radical history and Oppenheimer's lingering love for her). Finally Benny Safdie's portrayal of erratically-brilliant but self-serving Edward Teller (one of Hungary's ultra-brilliant 'Martians of Science' along with top Martian Jon Von Neumann of course) as another essential antagonist (alongside Strauss) although Teller's redeeming quality was that he was a certified 'genius' in terms of innovative scientific creativity, but he also played a crucial role in adding the final nail to Oppenheimer's 'loss of clearance' coffin, but it definitely feels like Oppenheimer and Teller did (at least in the beginning) harbor a mutual respect for each other's scientific 'gifts' which is exhibited on-screen so Safdie/Teller's film presence is always compelling.Overall, I agree that Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer' is a major Cinematic achievement that ensures him a place in the Top-tier of All-time finest movie Director's (alongside Kubrick et al) not only from a creatively artistic standpoint but from his sheer force-of-will and persistence to even get an immensely challenging project like 'Oppenheimer' financed, off the ground and on to those IMAX 65mm screens for all movie fans (and other imaginative dreamers) to See!",10,Oppenheimer
"Indeed. A movie about a troubled man who later wrestels with his demons regarding his involvement in the Manhattan project and subsequent acts of violence in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I'm not the judge of that since I don't know how the war in the Pacific would have gone if not for H and N. I'm not the moral arbiter to judge this man and his involvement. Although I believe he was used by the US military.You see much of what I described in Cillian Murphy's acting. He portays a man with some huge demons to live with. The start of the movie is a bit ambigous about why Oppenheimer did what he did in studying in Europe. The movie does say he needed to study quantum mechanics there and I can really see the movie depcts him as a genius who's plagued by what he wants to solve. The sleepless nights at university etc. Later he tries to fight against the system that wants to create more of his devices and more devastating devices. In my opinion Oppenheimer was not responsible for H and N. The generals and president were. The pilots dropping the devices were. I also think that he's pictured to be the one to understand what has happened after the war while others celebrate that the war was won. But at what cost.Act two is basically politics and what the government did to a man who tried going against the tide. They tried to silence him. Rob him of credibility. He is protrayed as the father of the nuclear bomb. (please IMDB that Time magazine, not me)The movie subtly studies the idea and consequences of the actions of these devices. Not for everyone definitely. Though a personal note is good to point out. I've played a few Fallout games and probably been somewhat sensitized. Nevertheles this movie should be 16+ mostly because of some sex scenes which aren't that bad. Basically actors dry humping because that wasn't real. Multiple minutes of needlesly showing boobs on screen. We would have gotten the idea of those two people having an affair with less boobs. It was basically just the actress sitting on his lap and in a chair but that chair thing. Why not put the dress back on? Though, breast aren't genitalia so that's why I said 16+.The other thing that I did not like was cutting too often, in my opinion, back and forth from two hearings to the Los Alamos place. Annoying a bit. They were used as plot devices but still annoying.The thing is, while Oppenheimer helped make the nuclear device, he also helped make nuclear power. If I had to decide I would take nuclear power over coal. Yes, nuclear waste but no greenhouse gasses.A multifaceted movie that does a good job in depicting a troubled man wrestling with demons of his own and the problems of the era. The 1940s were really dark era of mankind.",8,Oppenheimer
"Yes, this is a 3 hour movie with 99.9% talking, the other 0.1% is stuff involving bombs or chemical reactions. I would say I was not bored in this movie. I went in knowing its gonna be 3 damn hours, but Nolan did a great job of pacing, the music really helped make this movie not a snooze-fest. Also, do not go in expecting to see explosions and all this war stuff, there is not a single image of war in this film, which is a great choice. Minor spoiler but they don't test the atomic bomb until pass the 2 hour mark.If you are interested in the subject matter like me, you will find a really well done and perfectly acted film. There is not really a lot to complain about, but I feel this movie is best watched with subtitles since there are a lot of talking, a lot of names, a lot of accents, and sometimes you can't really hear what is being said because of the loud music.I would go and even say this is Nolan's best film since Inception, which has gotten better over the years in my opinion. I would love to re-watch this again with subtitles. Also the acting is great, and awesome to see Josh Harnett back. He really is an underrated actor.Anyways I say 9/10 because even though it is 3 hours long, it still felt like stuff was missing at certain points, Oppenheimer's wife barely had any characters, they jump two years in time and it didn't really feel like that was done smoothly.Anyways, a great film, 9/10.",9,Oppenheimer
A man who would forever change the world. This story is masterfully presented to us by Nolan in a biopic opera style film that is one of the most brilliant character studies that feels larger than life.Cillian Murphy is beyond excellent in this role. He says so much with his eyes and facial expressions that you know exactly how he feels in each scene. Robert Downey Jr comes back to acting when he clearly doesn't need to. He's a fantastic actor and the subtle times we do see him he grasps the audience!The soundtrack and sound design of this film is magnificent. From the pounding of explosions to the rumbling of chemical reactions. It feels like an amusement park ride and the nuclear bomb is the tippy top of it.Nolan relies heavily on exposition in this film more so than he does in other ones as this is a singular character focused story. There are alot of things that need to be explaining and it's all justified.An important piece of history is magnified into tiny atoms and blown up on the big screen in the most cinematic of fashions. Nolan draws the crowds and this one is a must see on the big screen.,10,Oppenheimer
"Long story short, this could've been a way lot better if it was shorter, less complicated and with a bit less of new character introduction.I had no problem with the timeline changing but throughout the movie I thought that I am missing something, Nolan kept introducing new characters and subjects as if we are already familiar with the story, which we aren't, he should really stop making his movies more complicated, great movies can be simpler too.We should've seen the bomb explode more dramatically (he should've used CGI), seriously, I was not satisfied with the explosion, too mild for an atomic bomb, the audience deserved better.It was 3 hours long and yet I felt tired of the pacing, seemed too fast and jumpy, not enough for the audience to fully understand.The acting was amazing which is not a surprise given that the cast are all superstars, so I won't give credit for that.Overall the movie was ok, but highly overrated and not worth the hype obviously.",7,Oppenheimer
"The acting was great, but the story was disappointing. The first two hours covered nothing. We didn't learn anything about how they invented and created the bomb. The 3rd hour was good with the story of the politics and the hearings. Nothing has changed our government is just as corrupt as it was back then. Could have left out the sex and nudity as it served nothing to the story. People that gave this a high rating is questionable. And the directer advising people to see it on the biggest screan they can is also questionable. Why.. they showed one expolsion and I don't need to see boobs bigger than my hole body lol. The last hour is the only worthy part of this movie. Wait and watch it at home those 3 hours are LONG...",3,Oppenheimer
"Best movie in my lifetime. All aspects were exemplary: the acting, the writing, the cinematography, ... I've never paid much attention to which director is doing what, but Christopher Nolan is one to watch for. Brilliant.Murphy was superb, as were all the supporting actors: Downey Jr., Blunt, Damon. Believable, moving, stunning performances. Top-notch writing and directing allowed these thespians to show the world how talented they can be.""Character development"" is tricky to do well. If a writer makes a character too unlikeable, the audience (or reader) won't continue to watch. Blunt's character, Kitty Oppenheimer, is a paradigm of character development. Like it or not, ""bad mom"" is a precise weapon used to cut down a woman. It's risky, then, for a writer to introduce us to a female character who is a bad mom, acts eccentrically, and has a drinking problem. Yet by the end of the movie, Blunt has us loving Kitty and cheering her for her strengths and character. Besides the great acting, this movie displayed the best example of writing character development I have ever seen.The cinematography was brilliant. I'll let others describe the details. I went into the theatre thinking the movie was going to be good. This anticipation made me a little worried that I'd be disappointed, because that's what usually happens when you go into a theatre with high expectations. Seeing the all-star cast is another warning sign of disappointment. Contrary to all past experiences, this movie exceeded my high expectations, and I walked out of the cinema mind-blown.I appreciate that the writers and Nolan showed the different ethical arguments, the philosophical debates, the moral quandaries with a deep dive into this sensitive subject. He/they didn't pander to popular political sensitivities, yet made it extremely sensitive in a thought-provoking, honest way. Nolan's integrity shone.",10,Oppenheimer
"To begin with, I want to make my opinion clear right away, this film is a MASTERPIECE! And it gave me feelings of ""12 Angry Men"" which is absolutely brilliant!It's epic. It's magic. It's strong. It's disturbing.The look is disturbing.Breathing is disturbing.The silence is disturbing.But it's beautiful!A film about a Man and not about an event, which takes the film to a completely different level!A film with constant dialogues, on different themes, with different characters that keep appearing. Just like life is, with constant changes, constant relationships, constant experiences.It's not an easy movie to follow. Every 5 seconds, the settings change, the dialogues change, the clothes change, the characters change... Timelines that mix and met at every moment. Dialogues that are completed at different times, and are related in crossed lines. It's a Nolan brand, it's auteur cinema. Sometimes, it's not easy to follow, especially in the first minutes, and it's something that makes the film not so accessible, but that makes it very rich!The settings are beautiful, the short shots in the actors enhance the film and the feelings that the characters are feeling, the long shots remind us of human smallness and the size of the bomb, of how insignificant we are if that power gets out of control, how powerless we are in the face of that.And if the first part moves us, frightens, disturbs, the second is not far behind. Through a well-developed plot, well tied, with very interesting dialogues and presences, the film manages to deliver the same tension as the bomb. And that's an incredible feat on the part of the script! It causes us again sensations of fear, apprehension, anger, frustration, for how cruel and insensitive the world can be, how science can be disrespected, how human beings can be as ""destructive"" as a bomb, when trying to go over everything and everyone, not caring about people's feelings, their suffering. It's a part that shows that through insensitivity a man can be as toxic and destructive as a bomb.Oppenheimer is very rich, it's a film that I'll have to watch 2, 3, 4 times to absorb every drop of sweat that Nolan, Murphy, the entire cast and all the people involved from photography, to sound, to wardrobe put into this project!Oppenheimer, it's not about a bomb, it's about the human being and life!",10,Oppenheimer
"This film deserves its own watch, separate from the double feature memes encouraged on social media.First, Oppenheimer itself is a weighty subject for a biopic.But mainly, this film is so nuanced, so rich, so textured in acting and videography, it just deserves time.Maybe a couple of watches, in fact, especially when it eventually goes out of theaters to streaming.Well worth the ticket price, however, so I might even pay that twice.Director Nolan deftly handles time cuts back and forth and makes every bit of his three hours in the theater count. (I worried at such a lengthy movie, but honestly the time flew.)Cillian Murphy is amazing as the.eponymous character. He manages to play all ages of Oppenheimer--I was dubious going in having heard this, but the man pulls it off.Murphy's range as an actor is amazing and he conveys both the patriotism and ego that led Oppenheimer to sign up as well as the change of heart he had in later years.Emily Blunt stands toe to toe as Oppenheimer's wife. She is strong enough to really act as his partner. And Blunt's rendition of Kitty responding to a board inquiry was so subtle (*chefs kiss*)Rami Malek as David Hill had a moment in a senate hearing had the audience actually cheer, but every single scientist/cast member was just spot on in their struggle to pursue theories without becoming part of the military group think atmosphere.And I really need to look up the real Leslie Groves and his story. Matt Damon played the part both as rather prickly, and yet with a strong sense of respect between the men.This sort of heroic character suits Damon well and the character felt like a real backbone throughout the piece.Now. Personally. I just want to give huge kudos to Robert Downey Junior as Lewis Strauss. RDJ has been in the big budget Avengers movies recently, a franchise which has been hit or miss for me overall.In Oppenheimer the actor proves once again how skilled he is playing heavier drama outside of genre. The Strauss story line was complicated and kept us all engaged until the very end (another cheer went up when he wasn't confirmed)Honestly, with such directing and acting, that should be enough.But every single department hits a home run.The effects--both sound and visual--are amazing.The musical score was perfect and elevated the experience even more.Frankly, you name it, I'd brag on it.But again, the topic is weighty and might take a second watch to catch all that I want to say.Even the feeling of existential crisis and messages for viewers were carefully enough placed that I felt ""reached"" rather than ""preached to"" and the payoff of that means digging into some books as well.Editing hit a couple of jump scares that actually caught me (and I usually never flinch at all.)",10,Oppenheimer
"The much awaited historical entry from one of my favourite directors, Christopher Nolan, is finally out. It's being well received from critics and audiences alike. After watching it, I can say it more or less deserves that reception.I did have the fear of not understanding this movie. Nolan has a habit of making his films as ground-breaking as possible. He doesn't want his movies to feel normal. He speeds up his storytelling and makes his dialogue scenes as brief as possible to keep the audience's brain working the whole time. So yes, in this film too, there are things that I missed. I understood the story, but I missed many character details that were thrown at me very fast in multiple different scenes. And I'm not sure whether this story even needed the non-linear way in which it was told here. You'll need multiple viewings to fully understand this film.Let's now talk about everything else. The story is available through various forms of media already. So I don't think anything new was written into this movie. What this movie had to do though, was to show this existing story. That it did - through brilliant direction, phenomenal performances, jaw-dropping soundtracks and the intensity that all of them brought to the story. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of the psychological effects on Oppenheimer, and Nolan's vision made a scintillating combo. In fact there are so many brilliant performances here - Jason Clarke, Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, all of them give some intense performances. Ludwig Goransson's score is just chilling (the composer of Black Panther). There are so many scenes here that just gave me goosebumps. There's a scene where Jason Clarke's character is arguing with Oppenheimer, and that entire scene was just amazingly performed and made by everyone. There's also the Trinity test scene which was brilliantly directed by Nolan. There are many such scenes.Overall I do think this is a great movie, but I'll definitely have to watch it again to believe that. It's great to see a historical drama be so successful at the theatres.",8,Oppenheimer
"I watched this movie in IMAX 70mm and what an experience it was! What Christopher Nolan was able to create here was something truly special. The performances from the whole cast is outstanding every actor and actress deserves an Oscar. Especially Cilian Murphy as Oppenheimer, he is so and committed to the role. Another stand out performance is Robert Downey Junior, it shows that he's not just iron man. The dialogue is so gripping and you feel so invested in the story that is being told. The scene when they actually detonate the bomb was spectacular. The way the film ends leaves you walking out scared of the world we live in.",10,Oppenheimer
"It's just astonishing how with such high expectations from everyone, Nolan still manages to deliver this master work, he has been my favorite director for quite some time, and there were many occasions where his films felt unrecognized (not by his peers which ultimately is more important) but by the award community, I hope this year things change.Cinema in its purest form, a high pace thrilling experience, one of the first aspects that amazed me about this movie in fact is that it's a biopic, and most biopics no matter how interesting the person they are telling the story about is, they tend to become tedious but somehow Nolan transformed this into an anxiety inducing exhilarating story.It feels as tragic as educational, while Nolan did an amazing job finding that balance of simply telling the story from Oppenheimer perspective without polarizing the political matters in place, and potentially antagonizing his audience, this is still a cautionary tale.How is it that we as a species manage to achieve greatness and we go back to our most tribal instincts when it comes to harm each other?How is it we are so good in bringing people together and with such great minds we have in the world we point them to fabricate the weapons of our own destruction instead of fomenting that knowledge and apply it to make our species a better peaceful version of ourselves?This movie has many layers to it, but the one that sticks out the most is redemption, we corrupt the people who are responsible for the development of our civilizations and contribute to further our knowledge and we discard them unless there's a use for them in the big war machine.Its hard to make a review about the film but be mindful that this is indeed a masterpiece, it's not the usual mind bending Sci-Fi experience Nolan usually creates, it might be even scarier as its an actual real life story that we should all learn from it and I can't finish this review without mentioning the Oscar worthy performances from Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr.",10,Oppenheimer
"It's rare to experience a movie like Oppenheimer in the contemporary Hollywood. This is Nolan at his best, using his experience in ways you'd never imagine.You are immediately hypnotised by the chilling soundtrack of Ludwig. The visuals and the brilliant dialogue are breathtaking.With a relentless pace that makes three hours go by inconspicuously. I somehow didn't realise how the last 30 mins of the movie passed by, and yet I felt like it could've used a few extra minutes.Condensing a book like American Prometheus into a 3 hour movie is a great feat.If this is Nolan's attempt at going for an Oscar, I wouldn't necessarily argue it. But I would add that this movie doesn't look like an Oscar bait. It's still got Nolan's touch.",10,Oppenheimer
"I've just witnessed the incredible work of Director Christopher Nolan, who successfully crafted a suspenseful thriller intertwined with a documentary about Robert J. Oppenheimer. I couldn't be more thrilled and amazed by his talent once again. The movie captivates with its fast pace and compelling characters, particularly Oppenheimer, who finds himself questioned in a hearing room, struggling to obtain security clearance.I must express my admiration for Robert Downey Jr., who delivers a pivotal performance in portraying Oppenheimer. Cillian Murphy also shines brilliantly as the father of the Atomic Bomb, showcasing Oppenheimer's guilt and humanity. The film delves into the profound impact of his actions, forever haunting him. Nolan skillfully weaves together the development of the atomic bomb, accusations of manipulation, and the fragile trust surrounding leaked information, creating a truly remarkable narrative. This director's ability to transform a documentary into an emotionally charged character-driven film is truly outstanding. It's an absolute pleasure to have experienced such a fantastic piece of cinema.",10,Oppenheimer
"At least 30 minutes could be cut without losing any of the story. The time jumps are confusing, though not as frenetic as in Dunkirk. The story is interesting, and the acting is well done. The film fails the Bechdel test in every way, and is in that regard an anti-Barbie. There are a few female characters, but they only exist to expound the story of men. Kitty especially should have been featured more, rather than a crabby and bitter shell. Why was she so miserable? We can imagine, but would've been great to see her story.The weirdest thing they did was leave Murphy's double pierced ear visible in multiple closeup scenes. It was distracting and easily fixable.",7,Oppenheimer
"This is one of the most amazing and fascinating stories ever - the development of the atomic bomb. Unfortunately, Christopher Nolan has chosen not to tell it. Instead, he has adapted the biography 'American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer' by Kai Bird. As chris2004 comments in an Amazon review of that book, 'I was looking forward to this book thinking it might go into the detail of the Manhattan project, the science around how the bomb was made, and Oppenheimer's contribution, as ""father of the bomb"". The book though only spends a brief time reviewing his work at Los Alamos and virtually nothing of his scientific work. Most of the other 500 pages just revolve around his social activities and, later on, the actions of the American Government to determine whether he was a Communist spy. A rather tedious read in the end. I can't imagine how they managed to make this into a film.' Indeed.The start, and much of the first two hours in flashback/flashforward are spent in interminable post-Trinity hearings where Oppenheimer is being persecuted for his alleged communist sympathies and connections. We get subjected to a beyond-tedious web of politics, egos, tale-telling and allegations, much of which is concerned with the pre-emptively answered question of whether an essentially retired physicist should keep his security clearance.The cinematography and acting performances are superb. Oppenheimer's back-story, relationships and moral dilemmas are well-handled. The most gripping parts of the movie are the re-creation of 1940s America and the development of Los Alamos. Sadly, opportunities to explain how the technical challenges of developing the atomic bomb were overcome are completely lost. For example, Oppenheimer leads a meeting of developers and mentions the relative required critical masses of uranium-23? Versus plutonium in about one sentence and five seconds. In later sequences, we see two containers slowly fill up with marbles as the elements are obtained. Drawings showing how the fissile materials are compacted together are briefly shown, but never explained. The movie shows presumably accurate models of the atomic bomb components, but again, there are no discussions of the actual physics. All we get are incomprehensible flashes of abstruse equations. We don't even get told whether the first atomic bombs used uranium or plutonium. That's how much prominence the science gets.The climax, the test-firing of the first atomic bomb, Trinity, occurs after two hours. The following hour is composed entirely of black-and-white committee hearings. What a wasted opportunity!",3,Oppenheimer
"Christopher Nolan's grandly ambitious film about J. Robert Oppenheimer takes on incredible dimensions such that it reaches beyond the contours of the typical Hollywood biopic. This film is also a retelling of America's desperate effort during WW2 to successfully construct a nuclear bomb before the Nazis could. It's also a sobering depiction of America's intense paranoia toward alleged communist sympathizers during the Cold War and beforehand. On both fronts, Nolan's portrayal is remarkably effective.Cillian Murphy gives the best performance of his career thus far as the utterly determined scientist whose brilliance was able to overcome his incidental flaws as a husband, coworker and government mercenary. We see the world at the dawn of startling change through his quietly terrified eyes. It's a magnificent breakthrough for science but for humanity, a new age of fear and uncertainty and Murphy's performance is the guiding hand. Strong supporting performances abound. Emily Blunt is effective as the thick-skinned wife. Matt Damon is the straight-talking Lt. General Leslie Groves who oversaw the Manhattan Project. Robert Downey Jr. Plays against type as Lewis Strauss, a founding member of the Atomic Energy Commission whose working relationship with Oppenheimer turns into a point of contention later in the film.The film's emotional high points are toward the end after a very early preview of the psychological turmoil that Oppenheimer goes through in comprehending the ramifications for humanity in the wake of his miraculous breakthrough. Without going into too much detail, it's a portrayal of the pitfalls of genius and immense responsibility. You leave with gratitude and humility for this part of history as a lesson but also as a cautionary tale on whom you can trust. Whether you watch as a film buff, a history buff or someone with a science background, it's a rare, rewarding film experience. A superb achievement and highly recommended.",10,Oppenheimer
"A truly well made movie about the triumph and tragedy of physicist Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. It is also a movie about Cillian Murphy who has established himself as a truly capable thespian having come a long way since the compelling ""The Wind that Shakes the Barley"", and the more recent tv series ""Peaky Blinders"" with the trademark chain smoking and careful straightening of the porkpie hat brim, also observed in ""Oppenheimer"". I'd be surprised if his latest flawless role execution didn't land him an Oscar, or at least a nomination for one. What perhaps might work against it, would be the enduring sensitivities surrounding the use of the atomic bomb and the vital role that Oppenheimer played in its development. But, his country asked him to do something and he did it brilliantly. He was a brilliant scientist after all, and in the world we don't only have scientists but we also have politicians. Take a guess who could be more dangerous.Like Prometheus, in one of the legendary Greek myths, who stole fire from the gods and bringing it to humans to better their lives, but not without consequences, that also meant giving humans a moral choice to use the ""tool"" for good or for evil.If there was a criticism of the movie, that would perhaps be the witch-hunt campaign directed against Oppenheimer and which, in my view, did not seem to jump out of the movie with the deserved poignance around this rather tragic part in his life and scientific career.",8,Oppenheimer
"This is one of the best movies I have seen in my life so far.I have seen it in IMAX format, it was the ride of a lifetime, the effects are spot on, the sounds are terrifying it feels like you are there part of the action of the movie.The pacing is very dynamic and there is a lot to take in as the story progresses. Actors have brought the best in this movie, you forget they are actors and start to believe the existence of the characters.In conclusion this is a must watch movie that will go in history as the best movie ever made in this decade.My recommendation is to watch it in IMAX, for the best experience.",10,Oppenheimer
"With his affinity for mind-bending, time-bending action spectacle blending brains and brawn, Christopher Nolan's blockbusters have a dedicated following among cinephiles. For Nolan, no amount of practical affects is too ambitious, no amount of IMAX cameras. I've always been a huge Nolan fan, and while it may sound a bit clichÃ© to say this, films like ""The Dark Knight,"" ""The Prestige,"" and ""Inception"" have had a formidable effect on my understanding of film. They taught me how audience expectations from blockbusters can be subverted by a formidable auteur, how action sequences can be combined with a cerebral narrative that conceptually integrates intellectual concepts as the backbone of the storytelling, and how to expect the unexpected from original and creative storytelling. Nolan's new film, ""Oppenheimer,"" may sound a bit more conventional and by-the-numbers than some of his other films, but viewers should rest assured that he has plenty of tricks up his sleeve to keep viewers engaged and thrilled. It is a completely riveting and extraordinarily well-made work that, in my opinion, is Nolan's best film.From the first frame to the moment the credits roll, viewers feel that Nolan is in total control of his craft throughout. Nolan's immaculate technical precision is on full display here, alternating between color and black-and-white sequences to stunning results. The precision and framing of nearly every shot in the film feels concise, controlled, and just like the highest possible levels of art--from wide shots of the New Mexico desert to intimate shots of a character's face. It all feels immaculately controlled and derived from a singular vision, to thrilling results rarely seen in modern movies. But what makes ""Oppenheimer"" so extraordinary is how it differs from Nolan's other films. It is not really an action film compared to most of his others, but the film is just as adrenaline-pumping, visceral, and intense. This effect is achieved by gripping nuclear test sequences as well as intense scenes of Oppenheimer's dreams and visions, as well as audio-visual depictions of the physical properties behind the atomic bomb. Credit is owed to an extraordinary sound design (perhaps some of the most gripping and intense sound design I've ever heard in a movie theater) and a powerful, melancholy score that accentuates every scene and further serves to demand the viewer's attentiveness throughout. Fortunately, the dialogue is completely audible and the score is never overbearing, which has been a complaint before about some of Nolan's other films.Some of Nolan's detractors have criticized his films in the past as simply clinical and cold intellectual exercises. I don't agree with them in general (although I was not a fan of ""Tenet,"" his weakest film) and am very much of a fan, but to some extent I can understand their arguments. However, the character development in ""Oppenheimer"" is comprehensive and brilliantly complemented by Nolan's screenplay, and the attention to a more character-driven film is something that sets this film above Nolan's others in my book. The actors further help the character-driven backbone of the narrative, particularly Cillian Murphy, who provides the best performance of the year. He truly inhabits Oppenheimer in every way imaginable, portraying a full acting range based on scientific inquiry, worry, and sorrow. ""Oppenheimer"" is both a gripping, IMAX-shot thriller and an intimately character-driven story that builds suspense, drama, and emotion in equal measure. For its uniquely character-driven scope and new, authentic ways to grip the viewer in thrill and suspense that are completely creative from Nolan, I consider it Nolan's best film (and I never thought anything of his could top ""Inception"" and ""The Dark Knight."") I cannot recommend it highly enough to patient and sophisticated film lovers. 10/10Note: I saw the film in The Big Show, Alamo Drafthouse's premium large format screen. This was an outstanding Big Show presentation, with the film's aspect ratio fully utilizing the entire screen and utterly flawless use of the Dolby Atmos sound system (even causing the seats to rumble at times, similar to Dolby Cinema screens at AMC.) This is a must-see in an excellent premium large format screen...but if you're a Nolan fan, do you even need me to tell you that?",10,Oppenheimer
"There is not a single thing I didn't like in this film.I haven't seen it in IMAX because I didn't have an IMAX theater near me but I saw it in Dolby Atmos theater. My number #1 favorite film is Oppenheimer! I haven't seen Barbie yet but I think Oppenheimer should win Barbie at box office. Christopher Nolan inspired me to become a movie director one day. The movie has a fantastic cast. Believe me but this movie will win multiple Academy Awards including best picture, best director Christopher Nolan, best actor for Cillian Murphy, and maybe supporting actors and actresses for Robert Downer Jr., Matt Damon and Emily Blunt. Cillian Murphy's performance was brilliant.Barbie might win Barbenheimer battle but Oppenheimer will always be a better movie and will win definitely win multiple Academy Awards!Oppenheimer is the most important person in the history of the world and I thank Christopher Nolan for making this movie.",10,Oppenheimer
"A spectacular film, one of the best motion pictures that was ever shot. The soundtrack of the movie was insane, it is three hours but you don't feel it because it is exciting from the start till the end, the cast was amazing, everyone of them did his role with perfect performance. Christopher Nolan did an amazing job directing Oppenheimer. The way he tells the story of doctor Robert was fantastic, they were able to make everyone in the theater so excited throughout the movie which is mainly focusing on politics without any action scenes and that's really incredible. I believe that this movie is the best cinema experience in history.",10,Oppenheimer
"A truly surreal experience about the world we're living in and the horrifying possibility of a doomsday.This movie has a pretty good chance of winning Best Picture and Best Director at the Academy Awards when it goes to war with Scorsese's Killere of the Flower Moon. It'll be a battle for the ages!As far as Cillian Murphy is concerned, I wholeheartedly hope that he wins the Oscar for Best Actor because he has absolutely killed it in his role as the father of the atomic bomb, easily the standout performance of the year so far and I'm confident it'll stay that way.Also the entire supporting cast was fantastic, especially RDJ and Emily Blunt. These two truly shine in their respective roles.This is what true cinema is all about.Nolan has done it again!",10,Oppenheimer
"I need to make two things clear. One, this film is not for everyone and certainly wouldn't appeal to more casual movie goers. It is an in-depth character study of Oppenheimer and is entirely about his life and is not a film about the bomb. If you wanted a thriller about the trinity test this film is not it, they don't start making the bomb until nearly an hour into the film, with the actual test happening with about an hour left of the film. The film isn't particularly exciting either but very interesting and definitely entertaining. It is thought-provoking not action-packed.The other thing I need to make clear is that I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan. I don't think he has made a bad film or even just okay film in his entire career (granted I haven't yet seen Following or Insomnia). I enjoyed Tenet even though it was too confusing and liked Dark Knight Rises despite its plot holes. So it isn't a stretch to say I would have liked this film whether it was deemed good or bad by most people. I also had astronomical expectations for this film. I admittedly got carried away with the hype which is something people shouldn't do because the majority of times the movie, game or whatever it is isn't going to be as good as your unreasonable expectations. Which is why I'm glad to say Oppenheimer met my expectations. Is it a masterpiece? I don't know, that phrase is thrown around too much, but it is one of the best films I've ever watched and a film like no other I had seen before.The pacing of this film is ridiculous. It's at a running pace the entire film and at times feels like the flow of a trailer. This is not a bad thing. Everything important you need to know is very hard to miss. That said, you do need your entire brain focusing on this film to take it all in and appreciate it. The speed of the film means it never feels too long like The Hobbit films and actual flies by quite quickly. I have only seen the film once but I am planning to go again and I can guarantee I will find more details and understand the story more in my second maybe third viewing. But you don't need to watch the film multiple times to understand it, like I said before everything is made very clear what is happening, just make sure your listening to the dialogue.This film is completely made up of dialogue, there is no action in the entire film. Some people would find this boring which is understandable. The dialogue is very well written and is delivered perfectly by all the actors, there's nothing more I can say really. But one important thing to mention is the sound mixing. This was a huge complaint for Tenet, rightfully so, and I saw some people saying the issue was present in Oppenheimer as well. For me it was fine. I saw it at the BFI Imax and there were something like two lines of dialogue I struggled to hear (I have since watched the film again at a different cinema and I defiantly struggled to hear the dialogue at the start of the film). Most people seemed to be complaining about the start being hard to hear but it was fine for me.A lot of people in the promotion of this film have said that this is the ultimate film to see in Imax. Whilst I don't disagree, the best way to see this film is on 70mm Imax and there are plenty of truly wow moments seeing it on a screen that big, I don't think it is as necessary as implied. Although I didn't see it in Imax, Interstellar seems like it would be a much better film for Imax than Oppenheimer. This doesn't mean you shouldn't see it at the biggest screen you can. Watching it at the BFI Imax was an unreal experience and you truly get immersed with the stunning cinematography and the booming score.Ludwig Goransson's score is his best yet. It compliments the film perfectly. I find it a bit hard to describe it without going needlessly in depth on all the musical features that make it so good. Lots of people has wanted Hans Zimmer and Nolan to continue working together again. I love Zimmer's work and have seen his performances live but I can assure you that Goransson is an amazing composer as well and could definitely be the next big film composer for the years to come.The cast is ridiculous as well. The cast is completely stacked with Cillian Murphy, RDJ, Matt Damon (who came out of a break from acting when he got the call from Nolan), Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh. There are big name actors who have just a few lines in the entire film some of them only being in a single scene, Gary Oldman, Rami Malek, Matthew Modine, Casey Affleck. Cillian Murphy is perfect as Oppenheimer, not only do they loom alike but he also really conveys the emotions and regret that Oppenheimer faced. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an amazing performance but not quite as good as some people are making it out to be. Don't get me wrong he is amazing I just feel like Emily Blunt is the best supporting actor. There is one moment near the end where she very nearly steals the show and is probably one of my favourite moments in the film.As in every film that involves science, when they explain a lot of it goes over your head. I was surprised to see that Oppenheimer handled that complicated science aspect really well. I have little knowledge of quantum physics just the very basics and I found myself understanding what they are saying at a simple level. They never dive in deep explaining the tricky stuff as well which is really good for the audience. I don't know if it was just me that found the science possible to grasp at and understand.The structure of the film can be slightly confusing. In typical Nolan style, it is non-linear. Three distinct parts of Oppenheimer's story are told throughout the film. One part is black and white, after the trinity test. Another is in what is effectively a court room but not technically one. And the other part which takes up the majority of the film is the chronological events of Oppenheimer's life. It is fairly easy to follow but there are a few black and white scenes that you can't obviously tell when they happened. One thing I liked that they did was that as the chronological life of Oppenheimer caught up to the black and white scenes after the bomb it would become colour. Its a nice touch that helps you understand what is going on.You can't talk about the film without mentioning the bomb. It is the climax of the film and the countdown to its detonation is so well done. The tension, dread, worry that everyone feels is very effectively portrayed to the point where I think the build up the bomb is better than the actual explosion. The explosion is by far the best nuke scene I have seen in a movie but I think the build-up is better in terms of the effect it has on you. The explosion itself is definitely the best looking nuke I have ever seen, with the film benefiting from Nolan's practical effects. At the time of the explosion you just feel this terrified awe as the perfectly shot bomb goes off. There's also a bit of a jump scare in this bit that took me by surprise.I could talk about more but I would be spoiling the movie. Thank you for taking the time to read my review, have a great day.I have now watched the film a second time in a smaller cinema and it was just as good an experience as the first time. The film is definitely better in IMAX now I can compare to a regular screen.",10,Oppenheimer
"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss.",6,Oppenheimer
"""Oppenheimer"" 2023. Biopic of ""Father of the atomic bomb"" J. Robert Oppenheimer. Written and directed by Christopher Nolan. Starring Cillian Murphy and an all-star cast and multiple cameo appearances: Kenneth Branagh, Matt Damon, Gary Oldman, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and her girls, Robert Downey Jr, Rami Malek, Casey Affleck, Josh Harnett, Tom Conti, Jason Clarke, Tony Goldwyn, Matthew Modine, Benny Safdie, and Rin Tin Tin.""Oppenheimer"" is a pretentious film that tries too hard and leads with technique. For this viewer, the film's thudding emphasis on film-making technique, and its rejection of conventional storytelling, was alienating. I noticed how incredibly loud the movie is. It was like being at a rock concert. Some scenes are shot in black and white. Some scenes are shot in color. Each scene is very brief. Who characters are is entirely unclear. Narrative is broken up into bits, juggled, and disjointed. Scenes take place out of time sequence. The film covers Oppenheimer's life from when he was a grad student to his old age. I had no idea why Nolan played the film out of time sequence.The all-star cast and multiple cameo performances drew a great deal of attention to themselves. That attention, in addition to the film's other technical emphases, completely made it impossible for me to experience any willing suspension of disbelief. I never for one second forgot that I was watching a movie written and directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Cillian Murphy. I never for one second saw J. Robert Oppenheimer on screen. I saw actor and star Cillian Murphy, who has come a long way from ""Red Eye,"" back in 2005. I kept thinking about Murphy's performance choices as an actor. He doesn't so much hand in three hours worth of acting; he hands in the same performance for three hours. Murphy always speaks in the same flat, monotonous voice. He displays virtually no facial expressions.When Gary Oldman showed up in a cameo as Harry Truman all I could think was, ""Which star is going to show up next? Kim Kardashian as Eleanor Roosevelt?"" I recognized Kenneth Branagh but I had little idea of which historical figure he was playing and what significance that historical figure had to the plot. When Tony Goldwyn, in what may have been an extravagant wig, appeared onscreen, I just kept starring at his face thinking, ""I know this actor but I can't place who he is.""Florence Pugh plays the part of a snotty and doomed woman who has an affair with Oppenheimer. Pugh is topless in a couple of scenes and bottomless in one more scene. Again, all I could think about while watching these scenes was ""Boy, she really wants you to see her girls."" I didn't care about any of the so-called ""drama"" onscreen. I never cared about the character she played, about the real life woman on whom this character was based, or Oppenheimer's affair with this woman. It was all flat, lifeless, something attempting to be drama, but never quite getting there. Oh, and then there was more NOISE.Read the New York Times review of Oppenheimer. Manohla Dargis praises the film. All she talks about is technique. She talks about writer-director Christopher Nolan. She talks about Nolan's decisions as to how much atomic bomb horror to show onscreen. She talks about how LOUD the movie is. She talks about ""complex structure"" and ""the plasticity of the film medium."" ""Superb cinematography."" ""65 millimeter film"" ""black and white film"" Look, if you are fascinated by filmmaking technique, ""Oppenheimer"" is the film for you.I would have walked out, but I was with another person, so I had to sit through three hours of utter boredom and, yes, contempt for this pretentious film. Nolan is struggling so hard to create a work of art that approaches the seriousness of the atomic bomb. For me, he failed. I cared less about nuclear annihilation after watching the movie than before I entered the theater.A quieter, more intimate, more coherent, more old fashioned film could have moved me. Any number of incidents from Oppenheimer's life could have filled a two-hour film and ultimately said more about atomic weapons than this three hour exercise in noisy incoherence. Oppenheimer tried to murder his professor. That could have been a two-hour movie. Oppenheimer confronting the awesome task of developing a weapon capable of destroying the world. What Oppenheimer and others confronted in Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. Oppenheimer's marriage. Oppenheimer was a womanizer. He was a father who gave his children away when they annoyed him. He and his women liked to drink and smoke and they all seemed pretty lost. Focus on any one of these features could have made a moving film. Instead we get bombast, pretension, and a movie that never lets you forget who made it.",2,Oppenheimer
"Even though Oppenheimer is far more cohesive and easy-to-appreciate than the divisive Tenet, the two films still share many Nolanisms: the ticking time-bomb scenario, scientific exposition, an intense, panic attack-inducing soundtrack (this is very much a sound-driven film), non-linear storytelling. How Oppenheimer varies from Tenet, and why it's a better film, has something to do with the acting. Cillian Murphy embodies Oppenheimer to the degree that it's impossible to imagine anyone else in the role, and he's buttressed by an impressive ensemble cast including Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr (what might have been...had he not devoted the best years of his life to Marvel), and many others who will certainly look familiar, meriting a visit to the Wikipedia cast list. It even becomes difficult to keep track of all these characters. Oddly enough there is no Michael Caine.Another point of improvement over Tenet comes, ironically, from the fact that Nolan is reforming what is by now the most stale and unremarkable Hollywood genre of all: the biopic. Oppenheimer has a better idea of what kind of film it is, what story it wants to tell, and how to tell it.That being said, there is something missing in the depiction of Oppenheimer's moral quandary; much like in Luhrmann's recent 'Elvis', the film lacks the knowledge (maybe strength?) to give its protagonist the truly moving, epic/tragic dimension he deserves. The difference is that where Luhrmann was immoral (his Elvis was by turns redeemed and destroyed by profligacy) Nolan is more amoral (generally concerned with physics and technicalities over emotional resonance). Murphy completely sells Oppenheimer's horror at what he's created, but when the film switches to McCarthyist machinations it's anticlimactic, almost beside the point, proving that Nolan is more awestruck by the effects of the Bomb on humanity as a whole instead of on one man. It still works dramatically, (and Nolan's position is far more understandable than Luhrmann's) but, much like in real life, Oppenheimer himself gets a little lost in the magnitude of his work. You feel his pain, understand him, but are not emotionally moved---history merely marches on. It should come as no surprise that Emily Blunt, playing his wife, feels underutilized.Putting all that aside, a striking feature of the film is Nolan's restraint: any other director would be desperate to spice the film up with violence and destruction, but we watch Cillian Murphy's reactions. The real climax of the movie is not Hiroshima, but the Trinity test, and it's here that the old cliche 'it must be seen in the theater' holds true. This scene HAS to be experienced on a huge screen to get the full effect. Home viewing or streaming will not come close to what I sat through in the IMAX theater, and I'll leave it at that.Ultimately Oppenheimer is still a singular, worthwhile experience which I plan to see again in the theater. It goes without saying that it's a better film than the more popular 'Barbie', a movie so ridiculous that even its supporters contradict themselves, saying 'It's just a movie about a doll! You can't take it seriously!' and a few sentences later: 'subversive masterpiece!' Out of these two films, infamously released on the same day, it's easy to tell which one will endure.Another quibble, coming at the expense of sounding too snobbish: Nolan and cinematographer Hoytema are far too obsessed with soft-focus compositions, which make up nearly every shot in the film. The innovative black and white Imax film looks incredible of course, but what's the point if it's shot in the same woozy fashion as the color sequences? One of the main effects of black and white film is an emphasis on shapes, forms, and position, which is how directors such as Orson Welles and John Frankenheimer were able to work such wonders with it. Nolan could have blocked his scenes more creatively and found something even more visually stunning than the practical effect nuclear explosion, but his depth of field is so narrow that it can barely allow two things to be in focus at the same time. This works when we're meant to be getting inside Oppenheimer's head, but for the entire movie?",8,Oppenheimer
"We know that the bomb worked. We know history. But the weeds of it, we do not.The writing, the acting, and, most of all, the restraint made this movie into a trie masterpiece.And I really do want to emphasize the restraint in my review. A studio exec or a less experienced director could have added in a scene where the bomb actually gets used In Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They would have made a spectacle out of it with CGI.But Nolan did not. Nolan trusted his writing and the ability of the actors to deliver the guttural horror of the atomic destruction in relative silence. Even without showing the physical destruction, the destructive nature of the weapon becomes too clear in more ways than one.After you see the movie, you truly realize that it was destructive to humanity in more ways than one. You get the sense that it was a spiritual and moral destruction, a blasphememous grasp at power.Now, thee movie doesn't say all that in a speech. But the acting and the writing makes it too clear.A phenomenal movie that all should watch.",10,Oppenheimer
"If you wish to argue in favour of Christopher Nolan being one of the visionary filmmakers of this era with a bunch of people, take them to an IMAX screening of Oppenheimer. After the sci-fi overdose that was Tenet, Nolan chooses to tell the story of the theoretical physicist whose name has nearly become synonymous with the atomic bomb. This is a man who had ambitions of epic proportions, and he had his distinct ways of getting there. The film takes you through significant events in the life of the titular protagonist, told in a non-linear style. It's almost like two parts of a single story running into each other from opposite directions (like a chemical reaction), eventually converging at a pivotal confrontation scene featuring Robert J Oppenheimer, Lewis Strauss, and Albert Einstein. This particular scene carries so much emotional heft when it unfurls at the very end, even when we get to see it play out from another angle early on. And that's just one of many such incredible instances of fantastic storytelling we see in the film!Cillian Murphy is someone who lets his eyes do much of the talking in the later acts, and he's absolutely splendid. There's a particular scene of him delivering a hallucinatory speech; the way Nolan stages it and how Cillian cracks open his saturated mind and lets us in - something you'll never forget! RDJ, as the friendly colleague turned eventual adversary of Oppenheimer, puts in one of his best performances to date. The changing camaraderie between RDJ's and Alden Ehrenreich's characters in the final act is incredible to watch. In fact, everything that unravels post the Trinity test is fast-paced, rich in details, and making you marvel at the audio-visual output Nolan and team have achieved. Emily Blunt also shines in the final act where she goes totally bonkers. Credit where it's due, the cast is mostly A-list and spot-on in their respective roles.I'm truly awestruck by the efforts that have gone into the visual side - Hoyte Van Hoytema's frames keep switching between various aspect ratios, colours, and elements of focus (including close-ups of Cillian's face). Practically creating the effects required for the explosion sequence would've been such a task. [Also, special kudos to the folks at DNEG.] How the film manages to strike the appropriate emotional chords and raise tension levels leading up to the Trinity Test sequence wouldn't have been achieved to this extent, if not for Ludwig Göransson's immersive score. Jennifer Lame's cuts give it definitive coherence, not for once letting us tune out of Oppenheimer's eventful journey.",9,Oppenheimer
"This was genuinely without a doubt the first movie I witnessed that made experience and sink away and forget everything around me.The sounds, the shots.. the double story that goes at the same time. I want to watch it again.Seeing Albert Einstein made me so happy for reasons I don't understand. And only near the end I realised Strauss is Robert Downey Jr.Great cast led by one of my favorite actors nowadays. So maybe I'm a bit biased.A movie like this makes me so happy I'm alive and greatly enjoy and experience emotions when I'm in the cinema. That I don't care that I show emotions in cinema. Crying laughter or just hapiness.",10,Oppenheimer
"This was one of the most anticipated films of the year. Because everyone misses Cinema, and great film making. We all know that Christopher Nolan never makes a bad movie, but we still wanted to know how he would tell a story that most people know his way.The film was brilliant technically, the camera work, production design, sound everything technical just worked. And what impressed the most was shooting scenes in Black&White instead of doing it in post, and it looked fantastic.The acting was absolutely amazing, if Cillian Murphy or RDJ do not win or at least get nominated during award season I would lose faith in the Academy Awards. The rest of the supporting cast was brilliant and in tune with their characters.The story was documentary style drama, with Nolan's typical convoluted time jumps. It was hard to follow in some parts, you really needed to keep up the entire run time. It might be off-putting for people that are not familiar with Nolan's work.The Sound was also loud again, and the dialog was on the low end. I got to like it now that he has explained why he arranges his sound in that manner. And the scoring was just perfect, I never pay attention to the Sound but in this one I did because it literally blasts you.This was a great film, but like any other Nolan film it requires a second viewing. I would highly recommend that you see it in an IMAX Cinema/Theatre.",10,Oppenheimer
"Another masterpiece by Nolan. This is easily one of the best movie in the decade.I couldn't talk about this movie without mentioning the briliant performance by Cillian Murphy. He aced the role to perfection. RDJ and Emily Blunt delivered a great performance as the Patriotic American, Lewis Strauss and Kitty Oppenheimer .Every actor did a great job.Score by Ludwig Göransson was absolutely flawless. It was perfectly able to grasp the tension between scenes. Another great thing about Nolan is , he knows how to use silence and he really made perfect use of the silence in this movie.Overall , this biography drama is a must watch and you should really watch it in the theatres. You will not feel the 3hr period of the Movie.",10,Oppenheimer
"I will reluctantly give it a perfect score even though I think it's the most straight forward Nolan film.The trouble I seem to have with it is that I wished it was more creative, more memorable. I give it credit that for a 180 minute, dialogue-heavy film it wasn't boring a bit but it could have taken more creative risks. The bomb was not as memorable as I imagined it would be. Where is that Lynch level atomic bomb? Where is the imagery that will remain with you? Florence Pugh is not enough, you naughty. The bomb should have been bigger and maybe even CG.Acting wise, it was the strong part of the film. Cillian Murphy is really acting his role to its potential but Robert Downey is out-acting him. I respect that. But beside both of them we have a big cast full of talent and the script itself was excellent and the delivery very nice. Proof was in the fact 3 hours flew by.Even with I wished it's still a very well made film, a epic one that will get another rewatch from me but not many, as I wished.",10,Oppenheimer
"Christopher Nolan has once again created a thought-provoking and visually stunning film with Oppenheimer. Drawing from extensive source material and interviews with those who knew Oppenheimer personally, Nolan crafts a complex and moving portrayal of the scientist tormented by the implications of his scientific discoveries.Cillian Murphy gives a nuanced and sympathetic performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer, capturing both his intellectual brilliance and inner turmoil. The ensemble cast is fantastic across the board, with standout performances from Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss and Emily Blunt as Jean Tatlock.Nolan uses his trademark visual style to make the scientific concepts and events come to life in an immediately vivid and engaging way. The wartime New Mexico scenes perfectly capture the tension and urgency of the Manhattan Project, while the scenes set in Princeton transport the viewer back to 1930s academia.Above all, Oppenheimer provokes important questions that remain relevant today. It examines the responsibilities that come with scientific progress and the line between scientific necessity and moral choice. While portraying Oppenheimer sympathetically, the film doesn't shy away from the difficult realities of the atomic bombings and their lasting effects.Christopher Nolan once again pushes the boundaries of what can be achieved in blockbuster filmmaking with Oppenheimer. Cillian Murphy brings humanity and nuance to the titular character in a performance that will likely be remembered for some time. Fans of Nolan and of thought-provoking historical dramas will find a lot to appreciate in Oppenheimer.""",10,Oppenheimer
"Was looking forward to seeing this movie on the big screen. Big fan of Nolan's previous movies and I usually like political and historical drama. On one side giving this movie anything less than '7' is hard, due to spectacular technical creation and a wonderful story told, but also I would argue that this movie does not deliver enough for its 3 hours length, in terms of interest and emotional attachment for the audience.I think most people will agree on what makes this movie a great Hollywood production, intense story and great level of realism, however here is a list of things that I didn't like:1. Unlike popular opinion, I did not like the casting. The actor list is full with big names, but many of them could have been better casted, in particular I did not like the cast of Matt Damon (as Leslie Groves, the army general) and Tom Conti as Albert Einstein. Even more unpopular, I think R. Downey Jr. Is also a bad cast and I kept seeing Iron Man instead of the character he was playing.2. It's quite boring. By at large the movie is pretty uneventful, there are pretty much 3 events - 1 is a surreal sex scene, 2 is the blow-up experiment, and 3 is the aftermath ""trial"". By the 3rd hour I saw people starting to check their phones in the theater. I usually get very upset of people that check the phone during the movie, but in this case I could totally relate with them.3. Failure to create emotion. I'm not sure what it is, but something really kept me from identifying with any of the characters. It is almost like the actors were too good for the role they are given in the movie, so a little tie-in with my complaint on the casting, or it could be the strong left-wing vibes in the movie, but the bottom-line is that you are not really feeling the pain of any of the characters.So, it's a '7', probably will win an Oscar or two. It is an important historical story but it felt too much like a history lesson then an entertainment piece, so overall disappointing for me as a big-screen experience and a Nolan fan.",7,Oppenheimer
"The story is simply not for Nolan. He did great with Inception, Interstellar, Memento, Batman, but the A-Bomb story is not the right material for his style storytelling.Endless mix of short phrases, never getting deep enough in the essence, jumping back and forth in time, shallow characters, ...
too cheap.Everyone's applauding, but why? Because of Nolan's name? Cast? The underlying story? Or just trying to appear intellectual rather than admit that ""the king is naked"" ?There is nothing intellectual in this movie, just the beaten pass of thriller-telling, the A-Bomb story is more complex deeper and deserves better.",3,Oppenheimer
"If you're going into this movie with the expectation of being entertained by lots of explosions, comedy, and filler screen time, you will be disappointed. This is a visual story. Its very intellectually created & exceptionally well timed out. Given that it's a 3 hour movie it does a wonderful job allowing the viewer to build a relationship with the main character to fully understand Oppeinheimers trials and tribulations and to understand what motivated him & shaped what would later become his viewpoint on the entire creation of the atomic bomb and overall criticism of the US Military's decisions. Another 10/10 for C. Nolan!",10,Oppenheimer
"Nolan's Oppenheimer barely qualifies as a biopic, at least not the thudding Hollywood variety. Instead it's a movie - a masterful one, among his best - investigating the nature of power: how it is created, how it is kept in balance, and how it leads people into murky quandaries that refuse simplistic answers.The three-hour historical biopic Oppenheimer is a gorgeously photographed, brilliantly acted, masterfully edited and thoroughly engrossing epic that instantly takes its place among the finest films of this decade - an old-fashioned yet cutting-edge work that should resonate with film scholars and popcorn-toting mainstream movie lovers for years and decades to come. Although it might be boring to a certain group of audience, Oppenheimer is for everyone, except those who never dwelved much into the director's finest filmography and what he brings to the screen.Every character seemed like a mirror to their original counterpart while portraying them. Cillian Murphy was nothing less than being an absolute pleasure to watch. The biography fully embraces the contradictions of an intellectual giant who was also a deeply flawed man, his legacy complicated by his own ambivalence toward the breakthrough achievement that secured his place in the history books. Most mature film by the director with an already finest filmography throughout his career, Oppenheimer joins and becomes a distinctive feature, which feels different from Nolan's other movies (with regards to genre) while feeling the same on many aspects (with regards to direction, trademarks)My Rating : 10/10.",10,Oppenheimer
"I went to see Barbenheimer with high hopes for this because I've been anticipating it since it was announced and this was truly the most excited I'd had been for a film in a while. My best friend had done Barbenheimer a few days before and told me to watch Oppenheimer before Barbie, but I'm starting to deeply regret that decision. Oppenheimer was so incredible that the bar was set tens of thousands of kilometres into the sky, which probably made me enjoy Barbie much less than I would've on it's own. I was still processing this masterpiece even when all the Kens went to all out beach war.There isn't one bad thing I can say about this film. I'm truly stunned at the passion, dedication and effort put into this absolute masterclass in film-making. The film is 3 hours long but none of the scenes are boring, quite the contrary, and it goes by much faster. The camera work and lighting is absolutely phenomenal, which really isn't surprising when Hoyte van Hoytema is your cinematographer. The use of extremely bright lights to mimic the explosion of the bomb, as well as to convey a feeling of anxiety, panic and guilt is incredibly well thought out and used extremely appropriately. The performances are also out of this world : Emily Blunt is extraordinary, Robert Downey Jr. Is amazing, Matt Damon is great, David Krumholtz is so fun to watch, Benny Safdie is dramatic but not to the point of being melodramatic and delivers a great performance, Florence Pugh really delivers as well, and not to mention Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, which is, in my humble opinion, one of the best and most well-casted performances of all time. The writing is phenomenal, the character work is phenomenal, the soundtrack is phenomenal, the cinematography is phenomenal ; what more can I say except that Oppenheimer is truly one of the most breathtaking pieces of media ever made.",10,Oppenheimer

""Oppenheimer"" is an unforgettable journey that not only educates but also stirs the soul, leaving a lasting impression on its viewers.",10,Oppenheimer
"So Oppenheimer didn't disappoint. Prepare for a relentlessly tense three hour investment with ample exposition and borderline horror tropes. Also prepare for a Titanic-style treasure trove of Oscars come award season. Cillian already has one hand on his statue, while Nolan will surely take home Best Film and Director. Downey might also sneak a Best Supporting. But the true master here is Ludwig Goransson, whose score ensures the exposition is never boring, amping up the tension to unbearable levels of dread. Couldn't believe it wasn't Hans Zimmer when I looked it up. Add the unbelievable sound mix and Oppenheimer is terrifyingly unsettling. It has all the hallmarks of classic docudramas like JFK and 13 Days, with MTV editing and time jumps, but is a superior film that must be seen on a big screen, preferably IMAX. Awesome 10/10.",10,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer: The Manhattan Project is central to this film but it is also about how Oppenheimer's intellectual development, his life and loves. Cillian Murphy is devastating in his portrayal of the great scientist whose mind was wracked with strange thoughts of the stars and of the Quantum World, a womaniser, drinker, chain smoker. Great luminaries like Heisenberg (Matthias Schweighöfer), Nils Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) and Einstein (Tom Conti) have walk on parts or cameos. The Einstein cameo proves to be central to the films narrative though. The film unfolds through two hearing and Oppenheimer's career progression on to being Director of the Manhattan Project. The hearing on Oppenheimer's security clearance in 1954 shows how he was deserted by many friends and colleagues but also uncovers the Iago behind this assault on his integrity. In ways Oppenheimer was his own worst enemy, careless in his choice of friends and too quick to make enemies. There are too many characters to cover in any one review but Emily Blunt puts in a creditable performance as Kitty Oppenheimer, having to hold things together, putting her life as a botanist on hold. General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) stood by Oppenheimer in 1954 but their relationship is portrayed as being stormy during the Los Alamos years, fights over security clearances for other scientists and even Oppenheimer himself due to past political associations. We even get to see Oppenheimer's involvement in unionising scientists. Even though we know the outcome the tension builds as the Trinity Test approaches. Fermi (Danny Deferrari) makes book on how may kilotonnes the explosion will be with a side bet on the atmosphere igniting. A tale of victory, betrayal but also of how scientists had differing opinions on the use of atomic weapons and the post war use of atomic energy. The two hearings head towards a conclusion just as the Manhattan Project does, all three resulting in different levels of destruction. Written and Directed by Christopher Nolan. 9/10.",9,Oppenheimer
"Absolutely loved the Movie from start to finish!It felt as if I was truly transported back to the 1930s and 40s. Great character and costume design. The casting of this epic has been magnificent. The writing is very powerful and symbolic. For a student of science like me, watching these big names of Physics being mentioned and used as plot points was really cool.The sheer elegance of the way Cilian Murphy portrays the scientist whose other worldly genius is almost tormenting his soul is truly an Oscar worthy performance. Known for his famous soulless stare in the Peaky Blinders, Cilian Murphy's Oppenheimer stare feels ached, his eyes act to convey the incredible inner turmoil this man has endured.Another performance I would love to single out is Robert Downey Jr, he is phenomenal as Lewis Strauss. His nuanced performance certainly deserves an Oscar nomination at the least.Matt Damon and Rami Malek are great in their respective parts. At times I had trouble reminding myself that it's not General Groves, it's Matt Damon!Nolan's direction shines through it all . With the use of practical special effects and low CGI, the movie seems a bit too realistic at times. The victories, the losses and the betrayals feel all too personal. Nolan's use of B&W to denote seperate times and contexts feels brilliant. The background score is beautiful and haunting at the same time.It's not all roses sadly, it feels like a lot of info crammed into 3 hours. Felt like it could have been a 2 part series. The nonlinear story telling maybe offputting to many. Oppenheimer's final fate is not touched upon. At least a small infographic in the end showing ""where they are now/what happened to them"" would've helped a lot.All in all, a solid film to watch for any movie enthusiast!",10,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer is a monumental cinematic achievement by Christopher Nolan! A deep dive character study(biopic) into a man who historically changed the world forever and how masterfully crafted!By far this is Nolan's least 'action' film that warrants lots of attention, there is no CGI but lots of conversations going on.. took his time to build the plot(kept it intense) then blast off ! The last hour was a gripping tale of the conscience of mankind and 3hours just flew by...Cillian Murphy was excellent as Robert Oppenheimer and Robert Downey Jr delivered an Oscar-worthy performance with the superb supporting cast all around! Terrific sound designs and Goransson haunting score was amazing!All this while watching Nolan movies and his filmmaking over the years, I thought he is someone god-tier level but after watched that ending of Oppenheimer tonight, I'm fairly convinced that he is the god ! Cinema at its peak!#Oppenheimer.",10,Oppenheimer
"Having seen every single one of Nolan's films and considering him the G. O. A. T. I've been waiting for this movie for over a year. Sadly, I was left incredibly underwhelmed. It started slow and boring and stayed here pretty much the whole movie. There was nothing compelling that happened at all. I know it's as a biopic, but this is Nolan...and where some criticize Tenet for doing too much, he did far too little here. I did not feel emotionally connected to any of the characters, they did not develop the conflict he was alleged to have felt, it was so difficult to understand the actors at times due to low speaking, poor accents and ridiculously loud bursts of music and sound, and it was about 45-60 minutes too long with dialogue in many places that not progress the storyline in any substantive way nor was it interesting. The only thing that kept me awake as long as I did was that the movie jumps around between around 3-4 different time periods while telling Oppenheimer's story. But you could spend 30 min on Google and get the same information you get from this movie or watch any of then various documentaries out there and get more excitement.Was this a bad movie? No, not in the least. But the hype around this movie centered on 3 things: 1) Nolan, 2) His take on Oppenheimer, and 3) The start studded cast. Only the latter delivered, and having seen the movie I now understand why so many A and well liked B list actors were needed.",6,Oppenheimer
"I think people are confusing ""a good story"" with a good movie. If you want the story, go to a library and read about the real life events. No matter what moment you skip to in this movie, it's a bunch of guys in suits sitting around a table. There are a few scenes that have small exposure to something other than men in suits in an office or sitting in a meeting, but it was over hype on the actual production quality, lacking a variety in set design and story inclusion beyond repetitive generic settings. The acting is decent, it just felt like a lot was missing to capture the full spectrum of emercing the audience in the time period of the movie and other aspects that could have been filmed to create a more comprehensive image. I could have enjoyed this movie as much by simply reading the script.",3,Oppenheimer
"I love when a biopic doesn't play it safe. Having very little knowledge of the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, I was very interested in how his studies eventually lead to the creation of the atomic bomb. Being directed by Christopher Nolan, I was already going to check out the film, but it also exceeded my expectations. This is filmmaking in its purest form (especially today). Here's why I believe this excellent film deserves to be seen in theatres.Essentially, Oppenheimer is about the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) and his influence in making the atomic bomb, but the way the film is structured makes it feel like so much more. Told in non-linear fashion, the audience is shown the trial afterwards, the planning beforehand, and the event itself. The majority of the film is a series of scenes with people talking in rooms, which may not seem all that exciting or appealing, but score did wonders for that. Many people complain about Christopher Nolan's films being frustrating in terms of hearing the dialogue, but I never felt that here and the bombastic score sucked me in even more. I was on the edge of my seat for the entire three hour run time.As always, Nolan directs the hell out of this film and brought out probably the best performance in Cillian Murphy's entire career. His performance is worth the price of admission alone. On top of that though, Robert Downey Jr. Also gives one of the best performances of his career in my opinion. Their scenes together were electric. Oppenheimer is also filled with endless celebrity cameos, but that just goes to show how badly everyone clearly loves working with Nolan. From the cast to the direction, from the score to the fact that there were no CGI shots, everything about this film was remarkably done.Oppenheimer is one of my favourite films of 2023 and it may just end up becoming my favourite after a second viewing. I was also blown away that the point of the film isn't really about the bomb itself, but rather Oppenheimer's life and how this bomb is such a negative thing in our world. It's eye-opening in ways I wasn't expecting and the screenplay only furthered that. With an insane amount of terrific dialogue that all flies at you at a mile-a-minute, I never once felt an ounce of boredom. I loved this film from start to finish and you can now catch it in theatres. Highly, highly recommended.",10,Oppenheimer
"An absolutely stunning achievement in cinema. Nolan rarely disappoints and this is one of his finest. Cillian Murphy's performance was nothing short of brilliant, along with the supporting cast. The sheer horror of what they created in that desert and its impact on history is conveyed with tension and measure. This is a three hour film and it feels shorter. There wasn't a moment where I was bored or felt it was dragging on. Nolan is a master or practical effects over CGI and the trinity test scene was executed so well. Along with the Los Alamos victory speech. Stunning. Overall I give this exquisite film 10\10 and highly recommend!!!",10,Oppenheimer
"I found the movie very disturbing. Oppenheimer is very enthusiastic about the development of the atomic bomb. It's obvious what can be done with this bomb. But it's not until much later that he realizes the horror of what he's doing. After he learns that children are dying! How convincing. I watched in horror as people applauded wildly when they learned about the devastation caused to the civilian population by the bombs dropped on Japan. I hope these images are just from an ordinary scenario. Murphy's acting is superb. I'll be surprised if he doesn't get nominated for an Oscar. I was horrified to watch this attack on the civilian population, which was not guilty of any crime in the history of the world, in the cinema. Not a movie for the summer months. I don't think it's Nolan's best movie either. But if you have an extra three hours, you can watch it.",8,Oppenheimer
"Experiencing a lot of emotions after walking out of the theatre. Anger after the final shots, then after 5 minutes of talking with people a feeling of love and admiration for this film and what it achieves. More truth about how the world works than anything I've ever seen. Greatest use of montage and music. Amazing editing. My favorite Christopher Nolan movie. It scared me. Some scenes are horrifying and literally shake you to your core especially with a powerful imax theatre.This movie made me cry twice especially after the bomb test scenes when they are adoring and cheering him. Not happy tears, mind you, despair. You may be angry if you understand the history (read the book) and the trajectory of military conflicts from then to today. Nothing has changed and it's incredibly moving and sad. Nolan is making a statement in the world we live in today as well. But after the film you feel joy at having experienced one of the greatest movies ever made. It's a masterpiece. When you are this immersed you aren't thinking about the acting or cast. It feels real. And that's magic.",10,Oppenheimer
"It's now over 24 hours since the end credits rolled but I find myself still thinking about all the great things I loved about this movie. Often when leaving the cinema your on a high when you have had a good experience it's very easy to be over enthusiastic about how good something is. In this case, having has that time to reflect I cannot fault this film in any way, nor any of the cast on their performances.I confess to being a lover of Christopher Nolan films, the weirder the better e.g. Interstellar, Inception. I love the way he challenges the audience. I chose to see this on the IMAX with high hopes but wondering if his trademark style would work in a biopic. I was not disappointed. From the very first frame I was gripped and held in that grip right to the end credits. Three hours flew by, it felt like I had sat there for half of that time. There is no let up in the story telling, rattling along at a great pace without any moments to draw breath. (Warning: There is no time for a quick bathroom break in this one or you will miss something important)Cillian Murphy gives an outstanding performance in the lead, and if he not in possession of an Oscar for this by this time next year it will be a travesty. The Oscar's are suckers for giving Oscars to people who portray real people and IMHO very few are worthy of it, especially when it it was someone iconic that already k ow so much about. This would be deserving just purely from the standpoint of it being a great dramatic performance where every facet of Oppenheimers views and personality is in show, and etched in Cillian Murphys expression in every scene, often in extreme close up where there is no hiding.The supporting cast are all excellent. Any number could be Oscar nominees but special mention to arouse Downey Jr who has never been better.Surely Oscar nominations are coming to for Nolan for direction and screenplay and a slew of other technical categories, none more so than sound, the extra cost of the IMAX ticket was worth it for the sound alone.Go see it, and see it on the cinema. Don't take my word for it. Kai Bird one of the co authors of the book on which is this based is delighted with it. He is also certain that his co-author would also have been delighted with it were he still alive to see it. I simply cannot recall any biopic that has had me so enthralled from start to end.",10,Oppenheimer
"This is more or less a feature documentary type of a movie made only for people who have the basic knowledge of Oppenheimer and the first atomic bomb.The movie is NOT for people who'd rather watch an action-y type of a film nor for people who simply are not interested in this topic in general. The movie won't change their opinion.As a person who knows enough about the man and the first atomic bomb and who knew that the movie will be in the style of a ""documentary"" I was definitely the target audience and I am glad I saw the movie in cinema.With that being said the movie has no business being three hours long. There are so many scenes that kill the pacing and should have been cut. The movie should have been 2h30m maximum or they should have made a mini series if they wanted to properly explain all the ""side characters"" and certain events that happened during that time period.",8,Oppenheimer
"I've honestly never been a huge fan of Christopher Nolan, and I will admit that I haven't seen a lot of his more popular movies (with the exception of The Dark Knight trilogy). From what I know about Nolan's work is how unique the editing is in his films, and you can kinda tell from the odd editing choices, specifically when Oppenheimer would hallucinate. While I do see how that kind of style can better develop Oppenheimer's character by visually showing us how he is feeling, I can see how this can be bothersome to some people. Personally, I really enjoyed it.I will say that this movie is really fast paced despite its three hour run time, and with that being said, it can be hard to follow at times. I'll admit that there were some scenes that just shove information down the audiences throat, and as someone who has ADHD it took me a while to catch up to what was happening in the story, and it doesn't help that Nolan likes to skip through time numerous times throughout the film (but then again, it did help that they had a balanced mixture of black and white scenes and colored scenes.While I do think this film is fast paced, I think the story did take that pace away from me with how the story was told. To clarify, there seemed to have been a climatic ending halfway into the film, but instead of ending, more consistencies rise and thus, more conflict needs to be resolved. Usually I hate when movies do this, but I oddly enjoyed the final act a lot more than the ""climax"" in the middle of the film.What people need to understand about this film is that it isn't about the bomb, well, it is, but most of the movie focuses on Oppenheimer's life leading up to him making the bomb, and the aftermath of what his creation has done after America bombed Japan. I thought they really told a great story here, and Oppenheimer, as well as many other characters in this film were written very well.Most of the film consists on talking, so if you're ere expecting a full-blown war movie, don't have that in your mind at all when you walk into this film. I recommend this to any history movie-goers, as it's pretty informative about Oppenheimer's life leading up to the creation of the bomb that practically ended World War II.",8,Oppenheimer
"I watched this film in IMAX last night and it was amazing and the ending will shock you. I thought the sound design and cinematography was superb but the acting was even better. Cillian Murphy had a phenomenal performance and Robert Downy Jr. Was very good and stuck to his role. I have seen every single Nolan film, but they way he sees his films layered out is far different then other filmmakers of this generation. Oppenheimer is a brilliant piece of cinema directed by brilliant Christopher Nolan about a brilliant man named Oppenheimer. Yet the realization of the creation of this bomb made me feel scared. Oppenheimer will now not only be known as the man who created the atomic bomb, but the one who is will end the world as we know it. True masterpiece.",10,Oppenheimer
"For those of you expecting massive explosions and thundering sounds of the bombs dropped on the two cities will be sorely disappointed. Overall a great movie spending great amount of time and detail exploring the psyche behind the creator of the Atomic bomb. Science nerds will catch on to same major name drops besides Einstein and be responsible to explain to the normies what ""Nuclear Fission"" means.Cillian Murphy's acting was beyond par and there is no doubt if anyone else could have replaced him on the role. The movie explores the politics in the background of the world war - both government and professional.My honest feedback for those about to watch would be to not buy into the hype of watching it in IMAX for the ""Perfect experience"" because this movie can be watched on a standard screen just as well. In fact I would say even better because a lot of the dialogue gets lost between the bass coming from the IMAX speakers.",7,Oppenheimer
"Yes, the acting for the most part is excellent. However, the movie/story does a grave injustice to the portrayal of a brilliant and complex human being. It presents a poorly edited one dimensional view of his life, a disjointed story dwelling mostly on political issues and travails. There was very little portrayal of his leadership skills in assembling brilliant minds to solve extremely complex, complicated issues. Overall, a missed opportunity to present the true richness of this incredible mind to the world. The editing seemed calculated to provide some of the actors with more screen time, and an opportunity to demonstrate their acting. By the end, I found myself wondering when it would end.",5,Oppenheimer
"The movie was amazing, but aren't all of Nolan's films? That's not what I'm hear to talk about though. As an avid movie goer I cannot emphasize how important it is to experience this film in IMAX. I have watched 100's of movies in IMAX and this is hands down the greatest one of all time. I could feel sound and pressure in my chest throughout the film. I was paralyzed in my seat until the final hour of the film.I watched it in my local IMAX theater, which is an amazing theater, but somehow I feel like I still did it a disservice because I didn't watch it in 70mm. Luckily there is one only 200 miles away in Dallas that I purchased a ticket for to see tomorrow.Again, Nolan's movies always have the best acting, cinematography, plots, pacing, etc.... This movie had something else beyond all the others.",10,Oppenheimer
"Nolan's best?Hard to say when everything this man does is groundbreaking. But this man is a genius, and if you didn't realize it before, you will after seeing Oppenheimer.Cillian wins the Oscar?There are times you forget that is not Oppenheimer and lose yourself in his heartbreaking performance. I see no reason to even nominate anyone else, The Academy may want to send the Oscar to Ireland now.RDJ in a non super hero?People forget that prior to the Iron Man film franchise he was a serious actor. Good Night and Good Luck was one of his best but his role in Oppenheimer has surpassed any role he's ever held. This may be his Oscar year as well, you end the film hating him so much.Emily Blunt?The forever drunk, emotionally immature Blunt gives her best performance yet. Being a selfish drunk whose side eye game dominates any scene she's in deserves our respect.Oppenheimer
I walked out of the film in tears and broken. No one wins. America builds a bomb, drops the bomb, wins WWII, only to enter another, longer war involving a terrifying arms race. Oppenheimer built a feat of science, then was thrown away by the US government that benefited from his invention as quickly as he tested the bomb. Once Oppenheimer realized the destruction he imparted, he realized that his selfishness and greed and need to be the best was all for naught. Oppenheimer doesn't win because he's labeled a communist sympathizer and loses his security clearance after championing a non-nuclear world. But the final scene, with Albert Einstein, who tells Oppy that they will love him until they don't anymore, and then they'll treat him like a relic of some long forgotten way of life-just as Oppenheimer had referred to Einstein earlier in the film-that is the moment it all comes together. I began to weep and couldn't stop. The despair and sadness in Cillian's face when it all falls on him at once, it will break your heart. There has not and will not be a movie like this for many, many years.Any negatives?I hold a Masters in Modern American History and a minor in Twentieth Century European History. Nolan did not put a single date in the film. As someone well versed in WWII, beyond the dates surrounding the war in Spain and WWII, I was actually unsure of the timeframe beyond decades. Even at the end when the single Senator voted against confirming Strauss, I knew it was JFK, but still could only say it was the mid to late 1950s. As a proud history nerd, I would have liked the dates. But beyond this, Oppenheimer may be as close to perfection as any film I've ever seen.",10,Oppenheimer
"This is the film that cements Christopher Nolan as one of the best contemporary directors working as well as one of the best to ever make movies. From the moment the film starts, it hits the ground running and never lets up. It knows exactly what pace it wishes to set for three hours. There are even moments where you may not be 100% percent sure what is happening, but rest assured it all comes together. See it on the biggest screen you can find. I cannot wait to see this again because I'm sure there are parts that I didn't fully grasp. I might say this is one of the greatest films of all time easily one of the best of the past ten years or so. Go see it - now......",10,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer is the first film to come from Christopher Nolan's new journey in filmmaking by switching it up a bit to make probably one of the best biopics in the past decade. The story follows J. Robert Oppenheimer on a mission to help develop the atomic bomb that will affect the world as we know it, while also showing us the political dilemma that is caused by it, as well as the affect it has on himself and others close to him. Cillian Murphy as the title character J. Robert Oppenheimer gives probably the best performance of his career as well as one of the best performances of the year and I'm glad that Christopher Nolan finally gives him his time to shine after taking a backseat in Nolan's previous films throughout the years. Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer I thought fit her role well, although I wished we could of explored her character a bit more. Matt Damon as General Leslie Grooves Jr is a great addition to the supporting cast and is one of the best characters of the movie. Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss absolutely nails his role and also gives a great supporting performance in this film. Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock was also great, although I felt her role in the film was to be more absurd with Oppenheimer rather than supporting of him like I thought her character would be and I figured her character would of played a bigger role than what was anticipated, but overall, she was fantastic as always. The score for this film is probably one of the best scores I've heard since Nolan's The Dark Knight (2008) and the actual atomic bomb scene was incredible to watch. I also like how Christopher Nolan was able to give audiences insight and show how dangerous a atomic bomb can be and the affect it has on people. If there's any cons I have, the way sexuality/nudity is handled is a bit strange, but also I can see why it's handled that way and the third act starts to drag a bit, but other than that, there's not really much to complain about. Overall, Oppenheimer is not only probably one of the best films of 2023, but also one of the best biopics in the last decade that will be revisited for years to come.",9,Oppenheimer
"This is one of the biggest Nolan film I've ever seen since Batman begins , dark knight and dark knight rises, inception, Dunkirk and interstellar. Oppenheimer was absolutely well done and seeing Oppenheimer make the atomic bomb and asking Albert Einstein for advice on how the world will see how atomic bombs will impact wars and peoples lives . Nolan did a fantastic job getting the best people for universal Oppenheimer. Emily blunt Matt Damon , Robert Downey Jr Florence Pugh known for her role in Blackwidow was so outstanding playing the old love flame Oppenheimer really nailed it. But I wasn't surprised when she did the romance scenes will Cillian. But I'm very proud of her acting . Cillian Murphy was the perfect man for Oppenheimer. He captured the man very well I hope he plays another scientist in the next Nolan movie . It's been 18 15 to 11 years since he played scarecrow since the batman saga . But I never knew Oppenheimer was a ladies man which Im very very amazed and surprised. Nolan hasn't done anything like this since the 2000s or 2010s . But he deserves the credit for directing Oppenheimer which has changed Nolan's filming career . He hasn't done a 3hr movie like this . When peter Jackson directed lord of the rings saga the hobbit , King Kong were 3hr long movies which I'm used to watching. The filming in New Mexico perfect place film . Atomic bomb was very very amazing to see. But the explosions were absolutely awesome and very real to my eyes . The effects were so outstanding no cgi this time . When the atomic bomb went off It felt like I was gonna fly out . But I have to say I was so amazed of all the incredible work Nolan did . The filming was absolutely incredible. It was like traveling back in time . The black and white was so well done and very well documented. Nolan did a fantastic job following the stories of the year when ww2 was happening, and the whole world facing many changes and Oppenheimer trying to became the next man to outdo manhood god . When I see Oppenheimer the second time I'll see it on a bigger screen in imax with my cousin in Burbank and Santa Barbara with my dad . I hope to see the cast at the Santa Barbara film festival and I tell them you were absolutely fantastic in the movie. I hope to see Nolan , Cillian, Kenneth Branagh, Matt Damon , and the entire cast at the Santa Barbara film festival .Hopefully when it's released on 4k there's an extended edition with longer scenes with Oppenheimer and more scenes with people talking about the bomb and Oppenheimer having a longer moment with Jean , and hopefully I'll see behind the scenes of how Nolan made such a remarkable atomic bomb movie in cinema history and how the cast of Oppenheimer worked with Nolan and what impacted the world of the atomic bombs today.Christopher Nolan congratulations on a job well done directing Oppenheimer for universal. I hope he works with universal again for another project.",10,Oppenheimer
"I gave it 10/10 because the movie made me shook with the explosion of knowledge, of truth, of the realness.The soundtrack is very well done like really good the sound effects are out of this world. The hole theatre shook with the explosionAll the performances were very solid. Oscars worth.The duration is well deserved and Nolan makes do with the time. Nothing is there just for the sake of being there.I agree with the critics saying the last hour divided a lot of people. It's very politically focused although there are a few plot twists which were very good. I myself liked the last hourI don't agree with what they said about the arc of the feminine characters. They had their arc. Everyone had their arc.Overall a must see in IMAX ou Dolby Atmos.",10,Oppenheimer
"This is the first ever IMDB review that I write because I need to give this movie my stars. The camera work is amazing. The cast is amazing and the story is even better. The only downside was the fast pacing wich you may see as a positive thing and the use op a lot of different names for characters. The use of those names was somethimes a little confusing but it does not really affect the story as it is always clear after some thime who they are referring to. Me and my friend just sat there in the cinema after the movie was done. Both baffeled by what happend and the ending. I got goosebumps 3 times from some moments in the movie, never had that before in my life. I have read some negative reviews wich say it was boring.... The only thing they think is not boring is dangeling from a thin wire above a 30meter drop or something but this movie was not even close to boring.",10,Oppenheimer
"Christopher Nolan returns to the big screen with a 100 million dollar budget and raises the bar for biographies, historical war dramas and cinema in its entirety. With an A-list celebrity cast, Oppenheimer delivers in every possible aspect. From cinematography to screenplay to sound editing, it is clear that this project was done with meticulous attention to detail and with an intense passion for the art of cinema.Portraying subjects of historical importance such as technological development, international affairs and military influence during uncertain times, this visually impacting project also presents a strong criticism towards a nation's system of order and egocentric political figures.It's rare to find a 3 hour movie that grasps viewers attention right form the start. With its fast paced tempo, time gets lost in interesting and intense conversations, accompanied by mind blowing sound effects that will create a long lasting impact on everyone willing to give Nolan their undivided attention.I am certain that this movie will be the best movie of 2023 and will probably be one of the best movies this decade. This movie undoubtedly deserves a 10 out of 10.",10,Oppenheimer
"Nolan fails at a very basic but important technique in film. ""SHOW, don't tell"".They do a lot of talking in this film about the decisions, actions and the results of what goes on in the film - but what makes the audience relate to what's going on unless you actually show the danger and the horror? Is this film made to make you think? Then they need to deliver properly. People get a HINT of the danger of the bomb but merely do clever politics around it. I'm quite disappointed in such a slow burn of a movie. What's more interesting? SEEING the results of the characters or just hearing about them in fast cuts? You decide. I love long discussions too and mindplay.Actors are great.. Cinematography is great. Score is great and the story is fantastic. The execution is just lazy and low budget.",6,Oppenheimer
"The result is important, but that's about it and e all already know that. The story is boring and the movie is the most pretentious thing I have seen in a long time. I get it, the result is a big deal, probably the biggest deal known to human kind. But the movie isn't telling me anything I don't already know nor is it making it seem interesting but oh boy it sure is trying. It's sad cause Cillian has been one of my favorite actors. But the movie seems like a whole movie saying ""this is important and we are important people telling you how important this is"". We get it. Was looking forward to this WAY more than Barbie, but honestly Barbie wins. Im fighting hard to stay awake for the second half.....GOD THE SECOND HALF! I have to go back in now, let's see if I can do it.",5,Oppenheimer
"Being a Chris Nolan film, my expectations were already through the roof for Oppenheimer. With a star-studded cast, it was set up for greatness. With this in mind, it actually exceeded my expectations. The acting, emotional impact, writing, music score, pacing, cinematography checked off all the boxes. I could talk about these concepts for hours, but I'll elaborate about what was most prominent.When looking at pacing, this 3 hour long bio pic starts off with a bang (no pun intended). I was immediately absorbed into the plot and, like a Amtrak train, the movie shot off. Usually, bio pics have some noticeable moments of down time, but Nolan's suspenseful style kept you intrigued the whole time. Oppenheimer may have the most uniform pacing out of all of his previous films.Oppenheimer is also dialogue heavy. There was so much packed into conversation that the viewer will be able to watch the film repeatedly and hear different perspectives with increased attention. The execution of this dialogue was profound. The final pieces of dialogue, including Emily Blunt and Jason Clarke stood out to me the most.Finally, the emotional impact caught my attention. I have heard from various sources that Nolan's older films ""neglect emotional connection."" This is definitely not the case for Oppenheimer. Fear and stress are demonstrated in a multitude of creative ways. From the foot stomping sound effects, to the bright flashes of white light. All of these features indicate a level of stress/anxiety that captured the moment perfectly and has a strong impact on the audience.This film easily deserves a five star. Oppenheimer blew away (no pun intended) my expectations to the point where I will definitely rewatch it in theaters. I'm a long time fan of Nolan films and am excited to see what he comes up with in the next 3 to 4 years.",10,Oppenheimer
"If there is anyone who knows how to direct tragic characters, it's Christopher Nolan. If you look at his resume, most of his movies focus on tragic characters, broken, victims of their own creation.J. Robert Oppenheimer is no stranger to that category, the man who created the atomic bomb in order to put an end to World War 2, has been haunted for the rest of his life with guilt and trauma over the results of his creation. Not only that, but after the war he was wrongfully accused of cooperating with the Soviet Union and was backstabbed by his friends and partners.I could go in depth over any aspect of the movie: the amazing assemble cast, the practical effects of Nolan in his movies and how his visual effects feel so real, the tragedy of the character, or the fear over a threat that still exists till this day (If you're aware of the Great Power Competition and the tension between nations, than the threat of nuclear war is lurking in the shadows).But I do want to focus on how the movie is trying to be so many things until it's not clear to determine what the movie is entirely about.Some may say it's a personal biography on how the atomic bomb affected the life of it's creator.Other people will say the movie focuses on the Manhattan project and the trinity test, the type of movie that focuses on a certain event or project in human history (movies like The Social Network, The Founder, etc.).There is also the option that the movie focuses on the aftermath of the Manhattan project and the ugly politics that happened behind the scenes, false accusations and political games (just like House of Cards and Succession).The problem I'm trying to point out is that Oppenheimer is a really complex film, this complexity is a bit overshadowed by how amazing and good the movie is, and I admire it too. The three hour run doesn't feel long to me at all.I guess the only problem the movie suffers from (but at the same time doesn't suffer) is it's lack of identity, a lack that I have a hard time to determine myself. Perhaps reviewing this movie will help understand it better.My favorite scene had to be the final one, when Oppenheimer is speaking to Albert Einstein and telling him that he fears of the chain reaction he has created. And then the camera shifts to Oppenheimer's face and he's imagining the destruction of the world, knowing it was caused by him, becoming death.In conclusion I just have to say on a personal note, that I wish more people would make movies like Nolan, Fincher and others. Movies that have a certain impact on the world of cinema. Forget about movies that are being used as a political tool for agendas or superhero movies like Marvel and DC that would not be remembered in a few years.Movies like Oppenheimer and many other good films that came out this year should be the ones to inspire young filmmakers to create something captivating and meaningful.",8,Oppenheimer
"Normally I am not a big fan of long biopics as most of them are completely dull and boring. Not so with Christopher Nolan's latest masterpiece Oppenheimer with an all star cast that includes Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, as well as Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and the great Robert Downey Jr.Oppenheimer is a three hour movie but it feels like its only two and the film is divided into three acts.: the background of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the atomic bomb trinity test and the final hour is devoted to the courtroom hearings of the Atomic nuclear commission headed by Lewis Straus played by Robert Downey Jr in another Oscar worthy performance. This film details the birth of the atomic bomb, how it ended World War 2 and the devastation of nuclear weapons in the world today.Everyhting about this film is masterpiece, the sets, the costumes, the direction and of course all of the performances. The explosion of the trinity test is worth the price of admission alone and it almost blew my eardrums off. The ending will haunt you and will leave you with a greater knowledge of one of history's most important landmarks.Oppenheimer will definitely be in the Oscar racce and will undoubtedly be on many critics top ten lists of 2023!Most of all it's a million times better than the awful Barbie movie.Oppenheimer is the thinking person's movie in a summer filled with endless remakes and soulless sequels It's definitely the best film of 2023 so far! Buy your tickets now!",10,Oppenheimer
"Christopher Nolan has outdone himself. This film will become known as his greatest work. He blends magnificent set design, compelling dialog, outstanding cinematography, and very fine acting into a lasting biopic masterpiece on the scale of something like Lawrence of Arabia. The Los Alamos sequences are unforgettable.There are a number of superior performances in this film. Led by Robert Downey Jr, who creates his best character since he was snubbed for Chaplin. Cillian Murphy, of course, in the lead role, appears to be a shoe-in for Best Actor, with Downey almost a certain winner for Best Supporting Actor. All other competitors will be hard-pressed to compete in these areas. Emily Blunt is effectively cold-blooded in her role as Oppenheimer's wife, but will face stiff competition from other productions that feature female, rather than male major characters. This film should win Best Film of the Year as well; best screenplay, and screenplay related categories, and almost every technical award I can think of. The film could use an intermission, and some of the sex scenes give it an R rating. I would recommend the film for those 13 years and older.",9,Oppenheimer
"Christopher Nolan Delivered.The comparisons to The Social Network are fitting and well-suited. The perspective of Oppenheimer being the focal point of this film was necessary and I don't think you could tell this story any other way, while at the same time hammering home the emotional impact in it that this creation left on the world.Cillian Murphy's titular performance and the amazing cast deserves all the recognition and praise. The third act is an absolute gut punch and felt through waves of the final testimony scenes.The three-hour runtime flies by and the message in the final moments of this film is felt and heard loudly. Nolan delivers a film of the decade with a resonating message that will sit with its viewers for days and hopefully years to come.",10,Oppenheimer
"It's a great movie ... it's not just about him making US nuclear power & world war 2 .., it's more about the human aspect , the way he was thinking after nagasaki and hiroshima attacks.It's a combination of brilliant actor Cilian Murphy & Genius director Christopher NolanðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

"A brilliant film from master director Christopher Nolan, whose catalogue of unforgettable movies continues to grow.Perhaps the most concentration required of myself at the cinemas since Daniel Day Lewis in Lincoln. But what a brilliant film, telling the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer and, as must be the case, the development of the atomic weapon that was eventually unleashed twice on the Empire of Japan to end the Second World War. (And, it could be said, begin a whole new kind of war).Cillian Murphy is brilliant as the titular character. Really, the entire cast was fantastic, but especially Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer and Matt Damon, especially well-cast as General Leslie Groves. A tip of the hat, also, to Robert Downey Jr. And Freddie Mercury himself, Rami Malek.A three hour movie that was gripping and intense, chock-full of information, the film switching back and forth between various stages of Oppenheimer's life. Some stunning visuals, a great script and Murphy's nuanced performance. What a fantastic movie!",8,Oppenheimer
"Heart pounding, adrenaline rush, breathtaking, mind-blowing...this is how it felt watching this movie for 180 minutes.Simply and gigantically this is movie making at its finest.Talking about scriptwriting which was orchestrated to deliver some of the smartest fast paced dialogues in cinÃ©ma history supported with genius sound mixing and score that was ment to rock your very core.Brilliant cinematography that puts you in the mind of Oppenheimer visualizing his very thoughts.Stellar performances all over, but Oh my My goodness, Robert D. Jr! Respect for a master class on acting!Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a master class in film making by all means. Even an IMAX screen is not big enough to watch this achievement.",10,Oppenheimer
"Like many this weekend, I spend it in a pact theatre watching one of the most hyped-up movies this summer. Unfortunately for me, not only was the theatre packed but the air-conditioning was out of order too, so it got warm and humid in there quick. If it weren't for this, I could tell whether some of the people in the audience left the movie because they weren't interested (in particular - there were a pair of girls next to me whom kept checking their phones - I counted six instances before they left around the time Jean Tatlock died. I didn't check the time so I can't tell how far into the movie that was) or due to the heat in the theater.The movie itself didn't meet up my expectations but I still managed to enjoy it. Does that mean my expectations are too high or did the movie simply not appeal to me? Well, let's try to answer that by discussing for whom this movie is - in other words, what's the prototype of the viewer this movie is build for. I think it would be best to start by quickly describing what the movie is about but here we meet our first challenge - I'm not confident enough to say that this movie is primarily about Oppenheimer and his quest to build the atomic bomb. No, this movie is more of a court drama with a backstory presented in stretched flashback and an epilogue under a veil of overwhelming drama but the movie also has nods to multiple conspiracy theories that were popular at the present time. The movie also mentions various other impactful events, like the McCartney anti-communist program that requires some context to grasp the the impact it has on Oppenheimer and the connections the links to communism (Elizabeth Cox case, for example) and I feel like context around Lewis Strauss is also important in order to decode some of the messages to fully understand the gravity of the situation. So it seems that the movie is all over the place with some links that require a specific cultural capital to connect all the dots. Having that in mind, I can only determine that this movie is build for those who have a wide understanding of the US history, especially regarding the context of the Manhattan project and the discourse that followed it.One thing that did bother me quite a lot was the portrait of a scientist and the science community that this movie attempts to push. It's in no ways a negative connotation but it isn't a honest one either as it's the most evident signifier of commercialization - to say it mildly, every one that represented science in some way was presented as a witty fellow that spends most of his time talking, discussing theoretical phenomena and coming to the conclusions on the dot. At a certain point doing the movie, there was a critical remark suggesting that Oppenheimer stopped being a physicist a while ago and he's more of a politician now. To some extent, I'd have to agree because most of the scientist were portrayed more like politicians. Apart from the basic quantum mechanics principles and paradoxes that we're mentioned early in the movie, most of the scientific discourse didn't have a clear message to connotate it's magnitude.On the flipside, I loved the idea how the creation of the atomic bomb in way did start off the chain event that will lead to the destruction of the world. The whole discourse regarding the moral and the philosophical consequences of the atomic bomb after the successful test was just magnificent and in a way that's when the real movie has started for me. The scenes with exquisite sound design and hallucination-like visuals of how the people in the room from Oppenheimer's perspective might look under the atomic blast were breathtaking. The ideas of having blood on your hand just for taking part in creating a weapon of mass-destruction are mind-boggling. And the visuals, the visuals at certain scenes do deserve all the praise. Although the story took too many ""off-road"" turns, at least in my opinion, I still want to commend the story to be rather comprehensible, even though it wasn't linear at all and had multiple jumps in time. After just one watch I can't tell whether the switch from color to black & white scenes helped to grasp the time jumps or not, perhaps it's just the room or surrounding or the context itself that helped connect the timeline in order, but the presentation in such of the story in such a way did help me to understand the story just a little bit better, leaving only the questions in context behind.Overall, I can't say this is a bad movie in any way possible but I can't say that I particularly liked it either. The hype for the movie was real - whether it was reddit post showcasing the massive film reel of this movie or early film reviewers portraying this movie as an important landmark in cinema - but I feel the hype also ruined the movie for me a bit as I definitely didn't meet the expectations it set off for me. At the end of the day, I'm just happy most movie snobs and just casual movie viewers can enjoy and appreciate this as a cinema marvel. Even though I don't fall into that category, I must admit that the general discourse surrounding this movie does make me happy and the fact that it made a lot of people look into such an influential figure in modern history is great too.",6,Oppenheimer
"A biography that could have been trimmed down by half an hour on each side. If you don't like slow biographies where half the movie is cross-examining people in a tiny room, Nolan is not going to make you like it now.The entire subplot around Strauss could have been chopped way down as I stopped caring about 30 minutes before its resolution. Seriously, the movie goes for at least 45 minutes of boring courtroom drama after the climax.Cool visual effects are few and far between, and the movie tries to present shallow and obvious ideas as deep and meaningful, such as ""the next generation of scientists will not be obsessed with your contributions and will be eager to make their own contributions"". The movie goes out of its way to show how Oppenheimer's and Einstein's work was just a small part of a larger system, and how humanity would have built the bomb one way or another, and then ends on the therefore irrelevant notion that ""Einstein and Oppenheimer started a chain reaction which will end the world"". Why should this feel shocking when the whole movie is talking about the inevitability that all of that would happen?There is a great little 1.5 hour biography to show to high school history students buried in there somewhere, but virtually everything Nolan did to try to make the movie more than that was a swing and a miss. If you swapped the name of the director and didn't use 20 A-list actors, I don't think many people would have much interest in this movie.",4,Oppenheimer
"This is one of, if not, the best that has come from Nolan. There wasn't a single moment where I had felt truly bored considering this was a 3 hour film with lots and lots of dialogue. The pacing was top notch, for what was 3 hours felt like 2.5 hours. Somehow 30 mins just vanished. Every scene felt like it mattered, I didn't feel any sense of a scene being filler.Now there are a few, barely significant things that did take me out of the experience but these are just nitpicks. One being Cillian Murphy looking far too old to be Oppenheimer during his university years (which I can understand considering there wasn't any de-aging that could be done as the movie had no CGI), the score being present throughout almost the movie. There are only two scenes I can recall without the violins and cellos, the third being the dialogue mixing could have been slightly better as there were some instances where I couldn't catch a piece of dialogue. Now here are the great aspects of the film.The cast is just, phenomenal. It is very easy to overshadow Oppenheimer considering the amount of talent that was present but thankfully it did not happen. Every single person was bringing in their A-Game. Cillian Murphy was fantastic, RDJ did amazing as Lewis Straus, what really surprised me was the intimidating and intense performance given by Jason Clarke as Roger Robb. If it had not been for how amazing Cillian was, I could definitely see an Oscar nomination go towards both RDJ and Jason for best supporting actors. It is a crime that Florence Pugh and Rami Malek did have hardly 5 mins of screen time but they played their parts great, especially Rami during the court scene with Straus. For almost every single character that existed in this movie, it is very difficult to see anyone else being played by another person.The sound design was top notch. Watching it in IMAX, the bass in the scene post Trinity test was overwhelming and I love how it portrayed the stress and anxiety that it gave Oppenheimer. Every other scene that did convey these uncomfortable emotions was executed flawlessly.The score was just, phenomenal. Ludwig GÃ¶ransson is one hell of a composer and I could see him as an industry leader soon in the future. Even if I feel as if the score was present for a little too long, I cannot deny how amazing it was. It accented every scene in how it conveyed the dread, stress, anxiety and the weight of a situation.Now thing I must commend the film's efforts on is the buildup towards the dropping of the bomb during its test. The tension was palpable, the countdown was anxiety inducing. And then, it goes off. The moment of silence before the shockwave hit is the moment that will stick with me for ages. The bright yellow/orange glow upon the faces of the scientists, the realization Oppenheimer experiences and the aftermath of what this bomb may cause. That first viewing of this moment is an experience I will never get.Overall, this movie is a must watch and if possible, you have to see it in IMAX.",9,Oppenheimer
"The movie is incredible. I love how they started from the beginning not just starting at making the a-bom. It was very interesting to watch his life and everything that happened. The visuals and the actors are phenomenal. I already had so much respect for Cillian Murphy, but hell this man can act. He was amazing and I loved RDJ as Strauss and Emily Blunt as Kitty. They were all so good! If you are like me and like your history stuff then you already know how it ends. But even though I knew, my eyes were locked on the screen, I was nervous, I was angry, I was sad, I felt relieved. It was a rollercoaster of emotions and I am glad that I had them. I know this movie isn't for anyone because 3 hours is a long sit, but for me it didn't even feel like 3 hours. I absolutely loved it, best actors, best cinematography, best music, best writing. I can go on forever. Go see this, it's a very interesting and big part of history and an incredible made movie.",10,Oppenheimer
"To everybody saying it's too boring, it's too long and there's too much talking, this movie is based off a biography of Oppenheimer's life during the Manhattan Project, the Trinity Test, and everything that ensured after. This wasn't a movie about the bomb but what it represents. Just like the splitting of the atom starting a chain reaction that detonates, the birth of the atom bomb started a chain reaction of destruction and fear that is still felt to this day. The movie does an amazing job at getting the viewer to feel the emotions that Oppenheimer felt after seeing the aftermath of his creation. Devastation. The way they used imagery and camera work to accurately depict his fragile mental psyche following the bombs dropped in Japan to the blatant collusion of the U. S. Government against him and trying to discredit and blacklist him as a traitor after he spoke against the bomb. Christopher Nolan has solidified himself as a generational talent in directing, storytelling and imagery with this polarizing and operatic film.",10,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer, could be, one of the best biographical movie ever existed. It does have a lot of ""heavy"" conversations but man, it leaves a strong impression and it is so compelling that made me speechless.Star-studded cast was not just for nothing, they truly, truly delivers each character perfectly. Especially Cillian, damn, brilliant performance. I truly wish that I could watch it in IMAX 70mm, the way they originally filmed it with.It is three hours long but I highly recommend you guys to watch Oppenheimer in the best theatre you could find in your city. Yes its gonna be boring if you're just accompanying your friend or S/O without actually intended to invest your time in this.",10,Oppenheimer
"Christopher Nolan's latest film is a refined, technically superb, and gripping epic, detailing perhaps the most important development in modern human history and the man behind it all.Thankfully 'Oppenheimer' isn't a cradle to grave biopic as these rarely work. Instead it charts the most crucial years of Oppenheimer's life as he is recruited into and leads the Manhattan Project. It balances a re-telling of the events with an exploration of the man really well which makes for a thoroughly engaging and complete experience.There is a risk that with a three hour film some of this impact can be lost and bogged down in unnecessary details, but fear not. Nolan's creative use of non-linear storytelling combined with expert sound design and editing conjures up a sense of urgency that ensures the film flies by and never loses its impact.As you'd expect with a Nolan film the cast is stacked, with too many great performances to mention. However a particular shout out needs to go to Cillian Murphy in the lead role. He brings the intriguing layers and complexities of Oppenheimer to the screen brilliantly with a captivating and engaging performance. Emily Blunt shines in the role of his wife Kitty, often stealing the show with her forceful command of the character, and Robert Downey Jr also deserves a mention with a well executed performance.Nolan is a master of his craft so the direction of the film is practically flawless. It looks and feels crisp and refined and the camera work is wonderful. The absence of Hanz Zimmer isn't felt, as Ludwig Goransson delivers a sublime score that compliments the film's themes perfectly.Christopher Nolan has conquered superheroes, mysteries and thrillers, sci-fi, and now the biopic. Oppenheimer demonstrates once again why he is one of the best directors of our time.",9,Oppenheimer
"Firstly, I am not a Nolan fan. That means I will not overrate and exagerate his averagely good films. Oppenheimer is a great historical drama not because of its directing but because of its interstellar casting from Downey Jr. To Malek, from Pough to Blunt or From Damon to Affleck. Not to mention Murphy who underacts just perfectly. Just wow... Even extras are famous in this movie...Editing and soundtrack are the two other significant reasons of Oppenheimer's success. Nolan is and was always surrounded with great crew members and post staff. His directing or lack of directing can never keep up with his unique imagination and writing skills.Go watch this movie because it is an epic Historical Drama not because Nolan fanboys said so... capiche?",8,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer (2023) is a lot. I feel like that's the best way to describe this movie. Obviously, all the performances were absolutely incredible, especially from Cillian Murphy, R. D. J, and Emily Blunt. Oppenheimer takes even mundane scenes to the most tense possibility. You'll probably feel the same in the seconds leading up to the Trinity test as you feel watching Cillian Murphy sit in a chair in the background while everyone else talks, it's that tense. It's also incredibly melancholic, the movie ends where you expect it to but the revelations and connections back to the beginning are perfectly executed. Oppenheimer was an incredibly complex individual and while the movie does want you to root for him it also showcases many of his shortcomings throughout his life. The Trinity test itself is beautiful in an eerie way and what follows is even more interesting. The dialogue is spot on and the sound mixing is insanely well done which is a big step up from Nolan's other movies. Definitely a must-see in IMAX. Almost perfect except for the sex scenes, especially the one during the interview, which were so out of place and made my whole theater uncomfortable. (9/10)",9,Oppenheimer
"I consider something masterpiece when it does not let you doubt for a second. The watching experience itself should be so absorbing that you don't even see any shortcomings. Yes later you might think of few. That is what this film is. It totally catches your attention, there is no flashy Hollywood sci-fi, action nothing. It is simple story narrated with excellence. Don't believe all those mocking reviews which say you need to know physics for this, absolutely not. Basic knowledge of science is enough and you get the context of stuff going on but yes you need to pay attention. Don't put your mind on those free refill popcorns and drinks. Narration is really tight. Performances are excellent. Background music as always for Nolan - awesome. I am giving 9 only because I was expecting more from the character of Emily Blunt, she is a wonderful actress, my concern is with the character, it could have been explored little more.",9,Oppenheimer
"Nolan did a great job hiding some extended details of this film on the trailers because I did not expect to see some of what I saw during the film itself. The film itself came off as kind of boring. The odd nude scenes and sex scenes also came off as crude and unnecessary. Some scenes like what was mentioned repeat or become redundant throughout the film. The film focused too much on Oppenheimer's politics and not enough on the man himself. I'm not a fan of any film that makes politics one of the primary themes. I knew that Oppenheimer had political leanings, but did not expect Nolan to go this deep into that part of his life.Footage of the climatic atomic bomb explosion seemed to have been kept to a bare minimum. His wife became a depressed and angry mess of a character as the film progressed. Oppenheimer himself exhibited some troubling behavior, as when he was speaking to a crowd, he was imagining a bomb going off as movie goers were greeted with grotesque imagery of people's faces literally being melted off. In summary, this is not a film that I would recommend seeing again.",6,Oppenheimer
I expected a thriller and ended up with a drawn out boring court case unfortunately. There are elements of the film which are entertaining but the film's third act is very dull and far too long.The trailer is brilliant and gives the impression of a fast paced movie.I just found myself looking at my watch too often and feeling frustrated by the end of the movie with how long conversations were taking.The positives are that the acting is of a very high quality at times and the movie is filmed very well.I am a Nolan fan and didn't want to write this review but the movie has been far overhyped.,5,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer is an enthralling character drama concerning the life of Robert Oppenheimer and all of the politics, challenges, and nuances that surrounded his work on the atomic bomb. Aside from an at times thrilling score to make otherwise relatively non-thrilling conversation between characters elevated, the film does not have any big dopamine moments aside from the detonation. All of this said, I was absolutely captivated the entire time. It is important to make this distinction because those with less... refined, attention spans may find it a near impossible task to tolerate 3 hours of this dialogue heavy film. I wish I could have experienced this in 70mm IMAX but digital will have to do.",9,Oppenheimer
"I had a high expectation for this one since not only Chris Nolan is directing but also my favourite actor Cillian is playing the lead role. When I watched this film those expectations were not only met but also exceeded. You really get into the head of Oppenheimer in the film. This one really is more about Oppenheimer than it is about the atomic bomb. This movie even though 3 hours long, will not keep you away. It has kept me engaged throughout. Editing, dialogues, cinematography and especially acting are on top. There is no questioning about Nolan's direction. That detonation scene though, it is hard to put it in words. I mean you have to experience it in big screens. I am glad watched this in IMAX. Absolutely brilliant. For me this is the BEST FILM EVER MADE.",10,Oppenheimer
"I tend to gravitate towards fiction more than fact. Never been a big fan of war, true events or biographies and I wasn't sure about this one, especially with its three hour run time. Besides Dunkirk (skipped it for obvious reasons) I have yet to be disappointed by any of his works and took a chance. Yes, I even liked Tenet...Robert J. Oppenheimer is often considered a controversial figure in the history of the US WWII. Dubbed as the father of the of the atomic bomb that claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the title would begin to weight heavy around his neck as he would try to unsuccessfully appeal to the president against further use. Hailed as a hero and then eventually tried as a potential spy for the Soviets, his loyalty would come under question as the eventual regret of his achievement and his past dealings with the communist party is weaponized against him by someone fairly close to him but who?I went in expecting a non eventful history lesson but got a movie with a slight mystery, instead. I am happy to say in today's climate, where it has gotten increasingly hard to bank on well known actors and directors to deliver a good film, Nolan still remains a reliable source for quality. His penchant for presenting scenes out of order, a slow but intense build of music in the background and short and quick lines of dialogue managed to keep the pacing quite brisk despite the long runtime and the lack of any actual action of any kind, it is simply brilliant. Perhaps not seeing any of the trailers and looking at a handful of reviews might have tempered my expectations? Or maybe I just got lucky that I found it entertaining unlike some of the movie goers around me. Eitherway, I will point out while this movie is great, its not perfect. You do need to go in with a tempered expectations as it has no action sequence, a lot of talk of theory and calculations along with a court drama towards the end. If you are expecting any scenes of war or action, you will be disappointed. However, if you have slight interest in science and are only vaguely familiar with name and facts around Oppenheimer, there is a story with a slight twist this movie tells and its well worth the watch atleast once.Speaking of expectations, a lot of reviews seem to point out a certain singular moment as a caution and its possible that the version I saw had been edited but I have to ask 'WHERE WAS THE LONG GRATITOUS SEX SCENE??"" Was it the intense breathing as the camera slowly pans by a wall? The only signs of nudity was a brief seconds of Oppenheimer sitting in a chair with his legs crossed, having a conversation. If this is a cause for concern then we have definitely gone backwards from the days of the FCC censorship. Because the scene is less than thirty seconds and subtle in a way where you don't really take notice.",8,Oppenheimer
"Title: A Critical Review: Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer""In ""Oppenheimer,"" Christopher Nolan plunges into the labyrinth of the Manhattan Project, depicting the life and internal conflict of Robert Oppenheimer, the man at the epicenter of it all. Nolan, known for his sophisticated narratives, delivers yet another stirring and profound masterpiece.Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer is at the heart of the film. Murphy captures the multifaceted persona of Oppenheimer with profound authenticity, manifesting the physicist's intellectual brilliance and the moral torment that ensued from his involvement in the creation of the atomic bomb. His depiction of Oppenheimer is a masterstroke in acting, brilliantly portraying a man on the razor's edge of scientific discovery and human destruction.Emily Blunt as Katherine, Oppenheimer's wife, offers a moving performance. Her depiction of a woman wrestling with the moral implications of her husband's work is deeply touching. Blunt's nuanced portrayal provides an affecting counterpoint to Murphy's tormented Oppenheimer, forming an emotionally resonant narrative core.Robert Downey Jr., in his most profound role since ""Chaplin,"" plays Lewis Strauss, the stern figurehead of the Atomic Energy Commission. Abandoning his typically charismatic persona, Downey Jr. Brings an intensity and seriousness that is riveting. His performance offers a stark look at the determination of the U. S. administration during the atomic age. His role as Strauss adds a layer of authority and command to the narrative, effectively embodying the bureaucratic pressure that fueled the Manhattan Project.Nolan's directorial prowess shines throughout, masterfully weaving together the personal turmoil of Oppenheimer with the wider socio-political climate of the era. The pacing is expertly managed, building tension incrementally before culminating in a classic Nolan climax.""Oppenheimer"" excels in historical representation. The production design, costumes, and cinematography blend together to create an immersive 1940s world. Shot for IMAX, the movie provides a truly authentic and captivating experience.However, the film's complex narrative structure could be a point of critique. At times, the story can feel a little convoluted, and certain plotlines may get obscured. Despite this minor shortcoming, the film's central themes and emotional impact remain strong and potent.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" stands as a deeply moving examination of one of history's most controversial figures. The compelling performances by Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and an unexpectedly serious Robert Downey Jr. Offer a rich and diverse portrayal of characters. Though the narrative complexity might pose challenges for some viewers, Nolan's deft directorial hand ensures a captivating and reflective cinematic experience. ""Oppenheimer"" serves as a stark reminder of the weighty moral responsibilities accompanying scientific advancement, leaving a lasting impression long after the credits roll.",10,Oppenheimer
"A full throated, adult - I mean to say perfectly serious - epic story about American exceptionalism and how that is more likely than not a total crock; what the film is truly about, at least in my immediate estimation before I sleep on it, is how easily it is to make many, many enemies in a country that is at SuperPower status in a world where Nazism can fold and then Communism (or just you know anyone the Government disagrees with) can be next. It's a terrifically absorbing and gloriously verbose film about the creation of the Atomic bomb, like the pure joy of watching science nerds writing feverishly on chalkboards (and the jar of marbles), but that's just part of it.What I think made Nolan really want to make this a reality, aside from Oppenheimer being an endlessly fascinating collection of mixed emotions and thoughts and genius and ""blood on my hands"" level of guilt, is how power is so completely at the mercy of who gets to be in control - and what it means for a fubdamentaly decent person to reckon with the power to destroy (the apple scene early on is an apt metaphor). The Branaugh line about giving the world the power to destroy itself, and not being prepared. It's even more than that: some may think they are prepared, while others just try to wash their hands with it. And all the while, you are plunged and plugged into a first-person perspective like few others this high-wired and singular (Taxi Driver is in this league). Haunting, really.Lots and lots of thoughts on this I still need to digest, but easily Nolan's greatest achievement at least as a writer - the dialog is constantly involving and urgent and dramatically alive (and just fun to listen to) in ways I'm not sure I've experienced from him, and the structure is going to keep me going back to it another half dozen times in the next year or two - and Downey Jr, among a titanic heavyweight cast ranging from Gary Oldman to Macon Blair, almost steals the movie from everyone as a world class shitbag (or, your typical DC power-player who got scorned once). And the ending is devastating.Some more thoughts on a second viewing: I know JFK gets brought up in reviews and with critics (and even Nolan himself), but I thought of Born on the Fourth of July for the set piece when Oppenheimer gives the speech; when Ron Kovic talks to the 4th of July crowd and all the sound drops out except for a baby crying and helicopters, it's a subjective perspective of PTSD to an extreme.I think Oppenheimer has that as well, and it's a traumatic sequence that really got to me on a second viewing, not only the blinding white light and the woman with tatters on her face, but the subjects as he's stumbling out who are a) making out, b) crying, c) vomiting, and other things. It's astonishing the degree there and at a few other key points where Nolan means to break apart his mind through his editing and camerawork.And after all Oppenheimer is a theoretical physicist who thought he could maintain himself with what he was doing, and he absolutely could not.... but then I think Nolan's point here, as Stone maybe had with initially deluded boy scout Kovic and Vietnam, is that... who can ever face that? It's bigger than everyone on a psychic level. It's about how Science and Politics can't be compatible. That's chilling to me.Nitpick on this rewatch: Florence Pugh is not given a lot to work with past ""I'm kind of batty and tragic,"" and while Emily Blunt gets more to do and is terrific, and I dont mean to say Pugh phones it in on what she's asked to do, it seems kind of reductive that she is more of a story device. This doesn't mean she doesn't have a pivotal moment - I don't mean necessarily *that* line - the dialog right before it, where Oppy tells her about nearly poisoning his professor. Is he Jungian? Is he that kind of helmet from Full Metal Jacket, Born to Kill and Peace symbol? Not quite, it's more complicated than that... or maybe so simple. Which makes that Pugh's Isadora and her small role more difficult to accept.Or, to put it into comparison with the Aviator, which is strangely another film I thought of this time (not just because Nolan at one time wanted to make a Hughes biopic, rather both films deal with subjects who have mania and horrible weights on their shoulders, this one though far more grave), if Blunt is Katherine Hepburn than Pugh is Ava Gardner. Oh, well.",10,Oppenheimer
"In a revelation that history books have overlooked, ""Oppenheimer"" brilliantly portrays the vital role of J. Robert Oppenheimer in ending World War II. The film delves into his profound stance on mass destruction weapons and their global impact. Once again, Christopher Nolan impresses the audience with exceptional sound mixing, cinematography, and a compelling script. Though the film begins slowly with numerous character introductions and politics, it culminates in a harmonious and thought-provoking finale. Not being a history buff myself, the movie ignited a genuine curiosity about Oppenheimer, demonstrating the power of cinema to spark interest and conversation. A special shoutout to Cillian Murphy, whose phenomenal acting brings the character to life.",9,Oppenheimer
"My first watch of this film was on opening day, second half of a double feature, and without the knowledge of critical response. This viewing was a few days later among friends in an IMAX theater. That viewing I was impressed with Christopher Nolan's technical ability and the performances are fantastic. I forgot how much folks overrate those aspects of movies until later in the day and the following days when I see this film being praised as one of the best ever.It most certainly is not that great.The politics are dumb and the storytelling choice is incredibly questionable. But to discuss the storytelling I feel it is important to break down the story.This is a biopic about Julius Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. How this guy went from a talented Jewish physics student to potentially the most influential scientist that has ever existed. From the start Nolan presents Oppenheimer as a gifted young man with a knack for understanding physics. We get the impression that this is the golden boy and a pure genius, everything wrong with stories about smart people. But after the start, we don't get much of that at all. Oppenheimer is then shifted away from gifted person to a leader who understands how to manage folks and does not pretend to be perfect and great at everything. Most of the science in this film is relatively silly dialogue that technically makes sense but I have no idea why they occur when and how they do, almost like Nolan doesn't really know how these places function. The film does get so far away from its initial presentation of Oppenheimer that it is regularly stated that this man does not participate in physics much anymore. Quite the contradiction that I think is done well enough and probably reflects the real story.Where Nolan gets into trouble is the explicit discussion on politics, of which this film is deeply dependent on. Something that I expected given the historical J Robert Oppenheimer mixed with how questionable Christopher Nolan's politics seem to be.I've touched on my interpretation of Nolan's politics in the films of his that I've watched so there really is no point in including those here as this film is more about how he understands politics that are different from his own. Capital-C Communism was almost the entirety of American politics from the end of WW1 until the fall of the Soviet Union. And really the height of its influence was probably in the years between WW2 and Vietnam, though its roots are much older, dating back to lower-case-c communism and the theorists of the 19th century. Oppenheimer very well was a communist in the academic sense of the word. He read all three volumes of Das Kapital, something that very much makes him more well read than almost all Communists, past or present. He even understood the concepts well enough to take his students to the massive labor strikes and union meetings that were a major part of global politics in the 1930s. This fact seems to be completely lost on Christopher Nolan as he presents communism, and subsequently Oppenheimer's politics, as a more academic incursion than it historically was. In fact most of the things that were later called ""Communist"" by McCarthyists were done by folks who were at the time, or later in life, opposed to Bolshevik theory. Much of the work done in the labor movement before 1918 was done by Anarchists and varying Left-Wing organizers, with only very few taking a positive stance on Vladimir Lenin's October Revolution once it occured. Only later, starting somewhere around the stock market crash, did the Vanguardist Capital-C Communist movement gain traction in large numbers in this country. It seems that the historical J Robert Oppenheimer was probably not a Vanguardist, judging by his disavowal of communism after the war, and instead one of the many people who supported the Socialist movement at the time that had genuine solutions to the problems caused by Capitalism.One of those problems eventually ended up being fascism. Communists, Anarchists, Social Democrats, and all the other differing flavors of socialist rarely agree on much but they all could come together and oppose the rise of fascism and the culmination of this ideology in the Nazi regime. From the inception of left wing thought, authoritarian use of existing institutions were always used to quell the labor movement. In spite of the overwhelming force of monarchists and Liberal governments, Socialism persisted and labor struggles were won from time to time. So when fascism came knocking on the ruined doors in interwar Europe, all leftists understood the threat and what was at stake. One of the last efforts in the leftist struggle against fascism took place in Spain during the fascist overthrow of the republican (in the academic sense of the word, not the co-opted American sense) government. The father of fascism, Benito Mussolini, and Adolf Hitler supported Franco's fascists while the Republicans and Catalonia were supported by international leftist groups, trade unions, anarchists, and the Comintern. It was a precursor to WW2 where we had very clear sides with one being fascists and the other largely being working-class folks. And yet the Liberal governments of the time took a stance of neutrality because while fascism was a threat to civil liberties and minorities, socialism was a threat to Capitalism (the entire reason liberalism exists). You were either opposed to fascism or you aided it and as usual Liberalism's inaction allowed the strong centralization of fascism to blossom.All of this nuance could have been presented in this film but that would require Christopher Nolan to understand worker's rights beyond the labels of ""Communism, union, or left-wing"" which I know he does not. Nolan understands these concepts in the post-FDR context that we all today are stuck with, unless for some reason you take an academic interest in communism.In the film, Christopher Nolan presents trade unionism and Communism as somewhat intertwined. The Communists are treated as shady individuals and the Communist Party as a shady organization, even in the non-Strauss scenes. This is the framing of the McCarthyists and Christopher Nolan accepts it and presents it objectively. Nevermind the fact that historical J Edgar Hoover and McCarthyists were as racist and anti-communist as the Nazis. We get the presentation that Communists are somehow just as bad as Nazis, which is the incredibly asinine garbage one would expect to hear from post-FDR liberals and conservatives. We get a good deal of screen time devoted to Communist Party gatherings of professors at cocktail parties and (I think) just one union hall meeting of laborers, none of longshoremen strikes or factory workers that Oppenheimer also frequented were pictured, and almost no screen time of what the Communist Party was fighting against. It is all once again just presented as an academic exercise of talking about communism and none of the actual labor organizing that was very present throughout Oppenheimer's time at Berkeley. This is because Nolan wants to clearly indicate the difference between J Robert Oppenheimer and the Communist Party so he can present how unjust the trials against him were - which they were, but Nolan either doesn't understand why or doesn't agree with the reason why and wanted to substitute his own.The Red Scare of the McCarthy era and the suppression and oppression of left wing movements were unjust because Socialism is not fascism. This is something that J Edgar Hoover (along with many powerful individuals) probably disagreed with and since his FBI was the leader of domestic investigation, they treated Socialism like it was a major threat to humanity when it was only a threat to the status quo. So when the war was over, the pivot back from fascism to communism was made and this time with all the tools and energy used to find fascists were used against leftists. So when Cold War era rhetoric (or modern day rhetoric for that matter) demonizes communism it is inherently and intentionally baseless because communism has always been a threat to Capitalism and the status quo. J Robert Oppenheimer was unfairly persecuted for his communist ties, not because he wasn't a communist (he definitely was), but because persecuting communists is wrong. But Nolan cannot admit that, either because he doesn't agree or because he doesn't want to agree.All of that could have been avoided if Christopher Nolan didn't try to include a political thriller in this film. This could have been a movie about the moral implications of the atomic bomb (and it half is) but instead Nolan wanted to weave in the politics because that is what he was publicly attacked for in his day.To mix in the political elements, Christopher Nolan reuses the non-linear storytelling he perfected in Memento (2000). While that film used it to portray faulty memory, this film almost uses it to portray faulty investigations. And I think it is deliberate, because if Nolan had made this film more linear then it would be very obvious how stupid it is to make two movies in one. But he did it this way and I think everyone can agree that the Strauss portion of this film is probably the most boring and unnecessary. Nolan probably only wanted it to undermine the criticism of Oppenheimer that was leveled against him in his day and to glorify the man for modern audiences. He wanted to whitewash the father of the atomic bomb.And finally I can talk about what J Robert Oppenheimer is known for today: the Manhattan Project.From all accounts, the science of the film and the progression of discovery on the way to the bomb are all very accurate and well done. Despite how silly I think a lot of the scientidic dialogue is, I cannot deny that everything about the Manhattan Project, Los Alamos,",8,Oppenheimer
"Witnessing the Oppenheimer was like walking between the two worlds, one is idealistic and genius while the other is a lasting nightmare where the consequences and actions sit on one man's heavy shoulders.Murphy was brilliant, if you think you'd loved him in Peaky Blinders you'll lose your mind over this one.Other actors performances were amazing and it's clear that a lot of effort, passion and planning went into this movie.Seeing this on a big screen is one of the best experiences I've had in a while, I've wanted to take a cigarette and ponder about a lot of things, staring into nothing (It's the Cillian's effect on me I'm afraid)If you are having any doubts if you should watch this, stop thinking and just buy a ticket, you'll understand once you see it. ðŸ”¥",9,Oppenheimer
I'll start off by saying it is technically a good movie. The acting is good and the storytelling is good if a bit too quickly paced. It basically starts off at full speed and doesn't slow down. There wasn't really any suspension building in any scene except the bomb test. My biggest complaint is the intense background music that never stopped for more than a minute or two and it gets old pretty quick. In fact I contemplated leaving the theater because the constant dramatic music was driving me nuts. It's incessant and takes away from the film. This movie would have been a lot better if it had 50-75% less unnecessary background music.,6,Oppenheimer
"Christopher Nolan's incessant use of suspenseful music is a crutch heavily leaned on in Oppenheimer. It seems as though the filmaker believes that bombarding the audience with intense musical cues will create an illusion of tension and excitement. However it becomes evident that the music is attempting to compensate for what is simply a very boring story line!Its an uninspired plot, which struggles to maintain even the faintest glimmer of interest. The runtime feels painfully stretched, leading to an inexplicable endurance test for viewers. I found myself counting the minutes until the credits mercifully rolled!!!",5,Oppenheimer
"Exceptional. One of Christopher Nolan's best movies. The cinematography is immaculate. The scenes are so crisp and intricate; can't believe they didn't use CGI. The cast, Cillian Murphy in particular, deserves an Oscar for that performance. In my opinion, the supporting roles of RDJ and Emily Blunt are also Oscar worthy, not to mention the spectacular portrayal by Matt Damon. The pacing, characters, cinematography, soundtrack, and story line exceeds expectations. This accurately paints a vivid picture of Oppenheimer's life and who he was. I think this film has a very good chance of being nominated and winning best picture at the Oscars next year. Go watch it on the biggest screen possible. A movie you won't regret seeing.",10,Oppenheimer
"After waiting for a year and seven months, I finally watched Oppenheimer, and it was totally worth every second of anticipation! The cinematography in Oppenheimer is a visual masterpiece. Each frame is meticulously crafted, immersing the audience into the world of the story. The way the scenes are shot and the use of lighting and color contribute to the film's captivating atmosphere.The chronological timeline of the movie is a true work of art. Nolan's seamless transitions between different periods in history not only keep the narrative engaging but also provide a deeper understanding of the characters and the historical events surrounding them. It's a brilliant storytelling technique that keeps you hooked from start to finish.",10,Oppenheimer
"Me and a few of my friends saw Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" on opening night, in the IMAX format for which this film was intended. The feeling I have after having watched this film is something I can't really describe, nor do I know how I feel about the film as a whole. I feel as if this movie doesn't directly try to tell you whether or not Oppenheimer was a good or bad person, but allows one to decide this for their own. Same with the dilemma of building such a weapon of mass destruction.I think the visual portrayal of the atomic bomb was magnificent. The buildup to this moment was nerve-wrecking and really put me on the edge of my seat. And when it finally happened; quietness. It was the silence before the storm. For a moment, we get to see the beauty of it, and then we are hit with all the destruction and pain that can come with it; the shockwave. And I felt it coming too!We as an audience get to see it mostly from Oppenheimer's perspective, as I understand it. He doesn't look at the grand scale of it, but instead seems to recognize his dreams (and nightmares) in this phenomenon; the atoms and molecules floating around in harmony, just like he envisioned.I disliked the frequent and abrupt cutting between scenes and missed some prolonged, quieter scenes. Lee Smith's (previous editor for Nolan) absence is definitely felt throughout the film. This film also misses another genius who has frequently partnered with Nolan; Hans Zimmer. Though the soundtrack isn't on his level, Ludwig Göransson managed to deliver a beautiful score full of emotion and suspense. I'm yet to listen to it on Spotify since it hasn't released yet, but I know it'll be a great listen.The acting was splendid from every star that featured in this film-which were a lot. Cillian Murphy in the lead role is obviously a standout, and I wouldn't be surprised if this role lands him a lead actor Oscar (nomination). Another standout for me personally is Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Lewis Strauss. I don't know anything about Strauss, but Robert felt like an amazing fit for the role.I don't know how much of this story is completely factual, but I was intrigued and interested by it nonetheless. I can't wait to do more research about the subject matter, just like I can't wait to learn about how Nolan managed to make this film without CGI. I'm still processing this film, so for now my rating remains at a solid eight stars. Definitely an incredible thrill that one must face on the big screen.",8,Oppenheimer
"I was intrigued to see what Christopher Nolan could do with a biopic about an important if perhaps little known figure from history. I vaguely knew the story but still learnt a lot. Give a theoretical physicist an unlimited budget, a tight deadline and get him to beat the Germans and Russians in turning theory into a real, working ""experiment"" which would quite simply change the course of history forever. Not a bad challenge.The science is clearly dumbed down enough so the general population can follow, which I think they did pretty well (though a physicist might say otherwise!). Add in a wonderful performance from Cillian Murphy and of course the genius that is Christopher Nolan and you get a very entertaining film. The soundtrack is magnificent as ever with Nolan and the film is beautifully shot. Some of the dialogue between Murphy and Damon is superb, even if Damon's portrayal of the brash army man was at times a little clichéd.I did enjoy the film and would recommend it. I think perhaps it didn't need to be 3 hours long. I think they could comfortably have shaved off 20-30 minutes without losing anything overall. Some of the post-experiment politics dragged a little for me. However I really am convinced Christopher Nolan is a genius and he's added a new string to his bow in taking on such a serious and potentially boring subject matter and turning it into an excellent movie experience. Well worth a watch.",8,Oppenheimer
"Is Oppenheimer a triumph in filmmaking?Yes.Is it one of the most important films of Hollywood?Probably.Is it Nolan's one of the best works as a director?As of now, I don't think so. But as with most of Nolan's movies, I believe that I'll appreciate this more on a rewatch.It is not the kind of story you'd expect from Nolan, but he tells it in his trademark style. The first act is filled with conversations and courtroom styled drama scenes. This should have been boring, but due to how these scenes are presented, the audience stays hooked. The editing and the quick transitions between scenes and timelines feel a bit confusing, but that's what Nolan was probably aiming for.The second act is much better and offers some of the most tensed and thrilling moments of the year. The whole Trinity test sequence is a masterclass in build-up, elevated by the glorious visuals of Hoytema, and deafening score from Goransson. I was awestruck.The final act is a complete horror film. A darkly funny horror film. There are some jump scares in the final hour which really caught me by surprise. The acting, dialogues, plot, cinematography, score; everything is too notch here. The 2nd act might be my favourite in the film, but the final act is definitely the most well made, technically.Overall, it's definitely a great movie and worthy of the major awards. Nolan gives another proof of why he's considered among the GOATs of directing. It does has some issues which are common in his other movies too; such as, expository dialogues, poor characterization, sound mixing concealing the dialogues etc. But it's such a well made film, that you can easily look past those flaws.Cillian Murphy and RDJ give career best performances. Emily Blunt is great too. The whole talented cast deliver great scenes, even though some of them feel underutilized. Hoytema is on his way to become one of the greats. Some of the shots here reminded me of Terrence Malick films. Goransson one again proves that he had the potential of reaching the level of Zimmer.This is a monumental piece of cinema.",8,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer Review: Very good movie, but be forewarned: it's long (3 hours) and very dialogue-heavy. People who aren't interested in history, who are distracted very easily, and who expect a lot of action will be disappointed. Every movie-making and storytelling aspect hit the mark. The cinematography, the musical score, the depth of characterization were all good. I only have one criticism, which is that the jumbled chronology of scenes made it kind of confusing for someone who wasn't paying attention or for someone who didn't have a basic knowledge of the story. However, the black and white shots coupled with the various location settings helped with this. Overall, an excellent film with a very important message: History is made by flawed and complicated people, who sometimes do bad things for good reasons, which can have both rewarding and terrible effects.",9,Oppenheimer
"Is Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer destined to be one of the best movies ever?That may be debatable - though I contend it is.What is undeniable is that is one of the most important films over recent years - a cinematic creation of rare intelligence and brilliant composition that poses timeless questions about technology and the capacity of humankind to control it.The story of Oppenheimer's fixation on the creation of the Atomic bomb and his subsequent misgivings of the super-destructive ""gift"" he gave the world is ever timely as we debate the dangerous future of AI and as invading dictators casually toss out ""tactical nuclear weapon scenarios"".Intricately non-chronological, Nolan's three-hour opus is assembled with all the precision of the complex super-weapon at the heart of his movie. Propelled by Ludwig Goransson's masterful score, the movie hurtles through time examining Oppenheimer's story and his contradictions. How did a brilliant man of good conscience lead the most destructive scientist project in human history - and what did that do to him?The performances are all excellent - as is, the overall historical accuracy of ""Oppie's"" amazing story.One last point. In a period when expensive Hollywood franchise films are floundering and losing oceans of money, Nolan's masterpiece shows what is possible when talented filmmakers - and not marketing executives - have control of the art form.",9,Oppenheimer
"Theres very few movies that have an impact on cinema like this one will. The star studded cast, direction, story and the other very pink opponent releasing on the same day. There are trends that Hollywood will try and manufacture unlike this freak chance of these movies being released on the same day. I truly hope that the film industry are taking note of true storytelling, heart and classic film making with little to none enhancements to the moments that truly matter.Where can i start with this cast, there can truly be 5 or 6 up for the 4 acting Oscars in 2024. Cillian Murphy is a shoe in for Best Actor, his harrowing portrayal of a genius that has the fate of the world on his mind and on-one truly understands the factors of what he has created. With a look he conveys a thousand words, with the support of Emily Blunt these 2 together weren't on screen a tone but yet again the impact they have on each others performances drive this to another level. From a sweet English legend (mary poppins) to an alcoholic American shows the breath of her acting range. When i heard the interview from RDJ that he was scared of taking this role and having to act again after his role as Iron Man this broke me. He smashed this role! In a film that spans hours his minutes on screen may beat Sir Anthony Hopkins Hannibal Lector record but the same impact across the board! Honorable mentions for Matt Damon, Jason Clarke and Alden Ehrenreich who keep all their stories flowing to allow a 3 hour film to be a a joy to watch.Then we come to an influential director that may be pushing for his Oscar with this film without making it Oscar bait like so many others in the past. If we get to Feb 2024 with people talking about this film its Nolans for the taking. Allowing natural, real and non-cgi scenery grounds this movie with the rawness on the forefront of movies just like the scientific breakthroughs that were happening on screen. Nothing has come close to this film this year! These are the films that when a director who writes his movies is allowed to create his vision and produces an epic. This is why he left Warner Bros. Over the last few years the medaling in directors creations stops the truest visions coming to realization.This is a word of warning though as proven by Thor Love and Thunder where Tiaka was allowed to run off and produce one of the dumbest marvel movies of all time!All of the effects have been highlighted as practical and this is the revaluation in bring back practical effects since Mad Max Fury Road in 2015. With the Atomic test being a practice effect i'd love to see how this is made. From visual effects to sound effects and editing, one word... perfection! Recently watching Interstellar and this had the same affect on me as that film!Theres no other words than prefect, actors, direction, story, score and above all the feeling of impending doom in a way that allows everyone to take a different take on who is right and wrong.",10,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer was just okay-good. It felt much too rushed at times, much too slow at others, but always forced.Though the acting was stellar, the movie itself was a long, jerky, scattered bio-pic that tried to do a little too much at the expense of being a great.I left feeling too many important themes were just glossed and insufficiently explored for a movie of this magnitude.Sometimes a movie tries to mention everything and ends up saying nothing.But it's always cool to see physicists, scientists, and math legends (and their famous egos) get screen time. The star studded cast and their incredible performances was the saving grace, but even they could only do so much to save the awkward pacing and complex themes left on the table, barely touched.",7,Oppenheimer
"As a science nerd and someone who used to be obsessed with the Manhattan project, nuclear bombs etc. This really couldn't have been much worse. There were maybe 15 minutes of interesting tidbits related to themes Oppenheimer actually dealt with in his life and the rest was just garbage. It's like they tried to make it into a romcom/political film that had very little to do with the actual interesting parts of Oppenheimer's life. I won't write spoilers, but I promise you there is not much to spoil. Endless drivel, dialog that literally put me to sleep for a few minutes.If you're interested in science and tech, just skip it. If you're interested in a good drama, skip it. If you like dull trials with too many actors and are really into dudes yelling every 5 minutes about ""russia"" or ""communists"" then go for it.",2,Oppenheimer
"Christopher Nolan, one film on from ""Tenet"", shows once again how skilfully he can bring mythological and complex scientific themes into the realm of cinematic glory.Oppenheimer is a dazzling crossover of the worlds of scientific theory, mythological epics, and harrowing practical realities. The audiovisual device and motif of light traveling faster than sound is ingeniously used by Nolan to illustrate how theory and reality don't always align foreseeably.Pet project aside, the story of the ""American Prometheus"" (J. R. Oppenheimer) needed to be told, especially in a way that grabs attention and turns heads; this truly matters; most definitely now in the midst of the knife-edge Atomic Age we collectively inhabit.The film couldn't be more relevant, especially when thinking about the ""Fermi Paradox"".As a biopic, this follows Oppenheimer's life and ascent through academia and his time in the Manhattan Project. Dialogue is spoken in a realistic, conversational volume but is still quite audible which serves to immerse rather than explicitly cater *to* the cinema-goer.This deceptive quietude is swiftly cut through like a knife by Ludwig Göransson's deliberately explosive score, showing the contrast between the humbleness, even of mankind's best and brightest, with the forces of nature beyond comprehension.Nolan takes his time to separate the man from the scientist, and we see Oppenheimer's vulnerabilities, egoisms, mythological fascinations (Bhagavad-Gita), and moral quandaries laid bare as his thinly veiled will to power reaches fruition. The film's sex scene particularly illustrates this.The lengthy three-hour runtime is almost an allegorical mirror of three-hundred years of development in the field of physics that culminates with the Manhattan Project.Nolan allows the audience to be, in an air of suspense, absorbed in the scientific breeding grounds - the hotly-contested, meandering theory, debate, and deliberation that gradually leads up to the final climactic event. What this amounts to is scientific poetry; yet Oppenheimer is more than a scientist; he is captivated by higher power and profound truths, things that lay beyond simply politics and science.Moral objections abound from the leading scientists of the day, and a slew of theories foreshadow, leaving something to the imagination about the tense atmosphere of the period, and what would come once the line had been crossed; the Rubicon crossed indeed.If anything could be changed, I would possibly depict the atomic arms race from the threefold perspective of Germany, USA, and the Soviets. But there's an argument to be made this takes away from representing the isolated uncertainty experienced at Los Alamos.The ending of the film is an astonishing commentary on the direction of scientific endeavour.8.5/10.",9,Oppenheimer
"After being a long supporting player and on TV's ""Peaky Blinders"" as now the former musician really is on the A List playing the titular character.His Oppenheimer is arrogant, cocky, and a womanizer but he is brilliant and smart despite let downs and people turning their backs on him as the father over in the nuclear bomb in dropping on Hiroshima Japan when the US was at war with the country after Pearl Harbor.Emily Blunt as his strong but long suffering wife and watching over their two children. Robert Downey as the college admissions director who hired him to teach and that he is really a sheep in wolves clothing.Matt Damon in a very rare supporting role as a US General hiring Oppenheimer while having doubts about him.Great support from people like Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett due for a comeback along with Alden Ehrenreich as an nameless aide.Jason Clarke as a ruthless and relenting prosecutor that leads the way over in the team trying to prosecute and discredit Oppenheimer. Tony Goldwyn also part of the team to also take him down.It is riveting and really shows in taking you all back to the 1940's. Christopher Nolan does it again.",9,Oppenheimer
"Obviously a lot of the talk about Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" has involved its release the same day as Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"". Now that I've seen the former, all that I can say is that you must immediately drop everything and go see this movie, for it reminds you of the world in which we now live.Topping the cast is Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer. Born of humble beginnings, Oppenheimer became a renowned physicist and contributed to the development of nuclear weapons. However, his anti-nuclear activism - combined with his association with leftists in the '30s - drew the government's wrath in the post-war years. Murphy adopts a less-than-handsome look for the role, and looks increasingly disheveled as the movie progresses, showing Oppenheimer's feelings as the government went after him.Equally impressive is Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife Kitty. If you only know Blunt from her audience-pleasing roles (Into the Woods, Mary Poppins Returns, Jungle Cruise), then this will be a pleasant surprise. Kitty was not what we'd call an ""ideal"" wife. Indeed, she often came across as a lousy mother. Maybe part of this was because Robert spent so much time on her work, but she was not the world's most likable person. It was impressive to see Blunt play an abrasive character for a change.But most important is what the movie shows overall. A man who had no malice in his heart helped create the most destructive weapon in history. That, plus the mind-blowing scenes of the nuclear tests, make this almost a horror movie (personal horror, that is).All in all, you should see it if you get a chance. If nothing else, it should remind us of the danger of nuclear weapons. As I read somewhere, as long as they exist, there's the risk that they'll get used.The rest of the cast includes Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek and Kenneth Branagh.",9,Oppenheimer
"This movie is worth the whole hype. The acting is phenomenal, Cillian Murphy was outstanding and how the history construct is amazing.I though the 3h duration would make the movie tiring but you are attached to the narrative the whole time, the way characters are constructed and the time plots are really well done. The movie also shows many psychological and political aspects from the time and from the characters that can be easily brought to the present, it criticizes the extremism in the duality of our current political scenario.Definitely we will expect some Oscar nominations for Oppenheimer.",10,Oppenheimer
"Sorry, but the film is bad. As always, the director relies on heavy music the entire time to build momentum in the plot. That means, one must prepared to listen to loud orchestrated music for 3 hours, including during during dialogues. We know, one doesn't need music to boost a script, once the script is good. The story itself doesn't need three hours to be told. The film also started in high speed and ended in high speed. That means, you the audience do not need to create expectations towards climax - there is no such thing. The way it starts is the way it ends. Horrible. Emily Blunt was great, though. And so was Robert Downing Jr.",8,Oppenheimer
"This is a love letter to science and scientists. At times it reminded me of the recurrent joke in ""The Big Bang Theory"" about Howard not being a real scientist since he ""only"" holds a PhD in Engineering. I was a bit disappointed with the sound but it might be an artistic choice. Do words, does dialogue really matter when you are retelling how the fear of violence from one side pushed the other to unleash the most deadly and brutal attack on Japan. This is a well written movie though the ending is disappointingly cliche for a Nolan screenplay. Around the two hour mark. It felt like it was getting boring. It might benefit from some cuts. I would recommend it in a double bill with ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"".",10,Oppenheimer
"Christopher Nolan is a genius. The pacing, the cinematography and the acting all coming together for quite the spectacle. Oppenheimer much like the man is a complex, layered movie. I found that the non-linear storytelling really worked for me and it helped heighten the moments of tension. I really liked the choice of only showing the Trinity Test and not the actual bombings, and the consequences of developing and dropping those bombs. The last hour of the movie and especially the last few minutes before the credits roll are haunting and will sit with you.Cillian Murphy is just amazing. I have always been such a fan of his acting and I am glad he's getting his flowers by being recognized for this role. Robert Downey Jr was chilling as Lewis Strauss. He has successfully shed his much loved but campy Iron Man role and has reminded us all that he is a fantastic actor. Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh were also good to watch. And the many surprising cameos.",8,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer is a great film. The cast is stellar , the cinematography is top notch, and the sound editing might be the most underrated aspect of all. The theme of annihilation associated with the nuclear arms race still resonate today. The only issue was the running time of 3 hours. I felt the film could have been just as effective if it shaved off about 45 minutes. There is a lot of time devoted to a hearing to determine whether Oppenheimer gets to retain his security clearance. This may be an effective way to tell a story but the stakes of the ""trial"" never felt that high. Similarly there is confirmation hearing for the Secretary of Commerce played by Robert Downey Jr. That is simply not very interesting when compared to the high stakes development and testing of the nuclear bomb.",9,Oppenheimer
"I loved the movie. It was an amazing watch at least for me. I won't be biased as I cannot call myself a fan of Nolan though I have liked most of his previous works. But to begin with, this is not a typical Christopher Nolan movie. His earlier movies were more into visual appeals and how he captured the panoramic and action sequences. Such scenes allow the director to experiment and come up with breathtaking scenes for the visual hunger of the audience which worked in Nolan's flavor, although, although, here comes the mastery of his work, as the movie Oppenheimer was not his typical action, thriller, adventure genre of movie where he could use his already hit templates, rather this was a plain biographical movie and his usual hit template had no use in it. The movie demanded something else, which was never Nolan's forte or maybe we weren't shown as such, with Oppenheimer Nolan showcases what he is capable of, which is, he is capable of pulling up a thriller cinematic experience out of a rather normal biographical movie on life of a physicist. He did not use any of his previous templates but rather focussed mainly on the dissection of the character of not just Oppenheimer but also people involved in his life. The colours of the characters one by one appeared in front of you just as layers of onion appear and the final colours of the characters when juxtaposed made the movie come out in flying colours. This was a rather perfect example of how direction and storytelling can engross the audience so much in a movie as if you are living someone else's life. This 3-hour movie was a piece of artwork and for me is the piece de resistant of Christopher Nolan.Coming to the acting point, Cillian Murphy was absolutely on spot in portraying the multi-layered character of Oppenheimer, it appeared as if he was performing his heart out. And for me, this was Robert Downey Junior's best performance as an entertainer. The cast performed so well that the movie appeared as a theatrical performance. Not even once did I feel that these were the same actors whom I have already seen in some other roles like Iron Man by Robert Downey Junior. Each of the cast members even the ones with a few minutes of screenplay performed brilliantly. It was a treat to the eyes and heart how commendable their performance was.To bring to your notice I have to mention that the movie is not a visual treat rather it is a cinematic marvel, so unlike the popular opinion I feel that this movie can easily be seen in normal theatres and watching it in Imax is not at all necessary although imax would make the viewing more immersive but commendable storytelling and a great piece of art does not demand an imax. You can go watch it wherever possible. Another point to be noted is that this movie is not for the general masala movie preferring mass. This movie is an art movie and not an entertainment movie so anyone thinking that he or she would get the vibes of earlier Christopher Nolan's work here will be disappointed as this is not similar to any of his previous work. It might be boring for some audiences as the movie has elements of science and politics which if you are unaware of, you might end up being confused, so at least a person must have an understanding of nuclear fission/fusion and a general understanding of world war 2 and world's condition at that time. Knowing more about scientists like Bohr, Einstein will only make understanding of the movie easier. But again if you watch the movie attentively with all your focus you will get what the movie is showing. The cinematography is on point and perfect, I could not cut any marks on the cinematography. This movie is a clear 9 out of 10. The only negative in the movie is as I earlier mentioned, it is not everyone's cup of tea and will not be understood by the normal general mass.Overall the movie is not a casual watch, it is a beautiful cinematic journey and a brilliant movie which showcases that Christopher Nolan has the versatility and dynamism to produce a piece of art where it is hard to do so. For me, this is the best and most densely characterized biography I have watched to date. This is also a caution notice to anyone who thought Nolan will only produce a thrilling adventure movie throughout his career, this movie is different from his previous works yet excelled the expectations. I hope he still has more to give us.",7,Oppenheimer
"Thanks for this movie , i enjoyed it, no doubt about that. But it was different than expected. Had in mind a more 'Dunkirk/Tenet´ type of movie. Missed the technology race against the nazies, the spies, the build-up to acutally dropping the bomb, the B29 Enola Gay story, the USS Indianapolis story, duck & cover, etc. So many stories behind this important part of history. Instead, lots of politics in a tiny board room and some kind of courthearings. But i should have guessed it from the movies title; it's all about the guy not about the bomb story. But as said, enjoyed it, but more 'Netflix' than a Nolan 'Blockbuster'.",5,Oppenheimer
"I saw huge potential for a strong and emotional ride here. I went in expecting a nerve-wracking journey of doubt, guilt and conscience. A story of a man who basically had the fate of humanity resting on his shoulders, during one of the most intriguing moments in history.And sure, we get some glances of that throughout this 3 hour spectacle. But unfortunately Nolan seemed more interested in communist witch hunts and endless interrogations with nothing but a security clearance on the line. All while hiding behind his renowned fast and complex story structure that favors momentum and style over substance. As a result we get a somewhat bloated mixed bag, filled to the brim with way too many characters, ideas and plotlines. Culminating in a dragged out third act with a disappointing lack of emotion and stakes.The introverted, cold and sometimes arrogant Oppenheimer himself is also quite hard to understand and/or sympathize with. A lot of runtime is spent on trying to figure out his (perhaps) shady communist roots. Yet we still don't get a clear answer, or why we should care or how it could possibly matter in the grand scheme of things. Just like we're constantly being told he's a genius, but never really shown why. Or that he has a wife and a lover, but we never quite understand what they see in each other.It's like the film can't really decide what it is or what's important. A political thriller, an epic disaster movie, an intricate drama, or a psychological character study? It want's to be a lot of things, and all of them sure are interesting. But when non of them is given enough emphasis or time to develop in a satisfying way, it mostly comes off as a confusing pile of missed opportunities. On top of that, the editing is also very fast paced and few things on screen gets a chance to land properly, or give you any room to breath or reflect. This obsession of forward motion makes the whole thing feel pretty inorganic and calculated, and quite exhausting to experience.On the good side: It's good craftsmanship overall (as usual by Nolan), even though the IMAX format for this felt... Well a bit unnecessary to be honest, when the film is 90% driven by scenes of heavy dialogue in mundane settings. The cast is doing a fine job, and Murphys portrayal of Oppenheimer is pretty solid within the restraints of the script.The score is pretty good too, but overused and poorly mixed. In other words it follows the exact same pattern from Nolans latest film ""Tenet"" - where they also insisted on putting Ludwig Göransson's dramatic score all over the place, even on long dumps of exposition or dialogue. It's like Nolan is trying to inject the viewer with a false sense of tension or urgency into scenes that don't have any. It feels incredibly weird and disjointed at times, especially in scenes where it's basically a couple of guys sitting around a table.Not long ago, going to the cinema to witness Chris Nolans latest film was a no-brainer. You knew before you went in, without watching any trailers beforehand, that it will be worth your time and the price of the ticket. After Tenet and now this, I'm keeping my expectations in check...",8,Oppenheimer
"I've been a big Christopher Nolan fan for a while (surprising, considering I'm a film bro, I know), but can't help but feel most of his offerings in the 2010s have been...in my opinion, weaker than his previous work. For me, films like Dunkirk and Tenet come off as cold nd lifeless, more interested in intricate film making than telling a compelling story. Nolan seems to actively want to alienate the audience with these movies. Interestellar and The Dark Knight Rises, on the other hand, almost feel too sentimental, betraying Nolan's characteristic fixation on logical storytelling for endings that seem like studio encouraged ""feel good"" endings that aren't necessarily earned.That's all to say Oppenheimer strikes the balance between Nolan's almost mechanical view of storytelling - with various parts moving in tandem to get to an end goal - with the heart and humanity to keep the audience invested. It's his best movie since Inception.Despite being 3 hours long, Oppenheimer was never boring or slow to me. If anything, one of the biggest issues with the film is its pacing in the beginning; it does feel somewhat edited like a movie trailer, jumping from scene to scene as we attempt to get an understanding of Oppenheimer's life. It does feel a bit too fast for the first chunk of the movie, but it's all worth it in the end. Once the main plot gets going, the movie really picks up its energy and something truly special. If I had one big complaint about this movie, it's the opening act (and to me, it's significant enough to hold this movie back from being a true masterpiece).Cillian Murphy is absolutely incredible as J. Robert Oppenheimer; he embodies the man to such an extent that he basically disappears into the role. He is Oppenheimer, by the end of the movie, just so total and compelling a depiction of this fascinating historical figure that it reminds me why biopics still matter, even if the genre itself has become a bit of a parody. Robert Downey Jr. Is also incredible in this movie, disappearing into the role of conniving head of the Atomic Energy Association and surely earning himself a Best Supporting Actor nod. I also really like Matt Damon in this movie; for such dense and sometimes difficult subject matter, he brought a warmth, charm, and charisma to his scenes that felt oddly comforting.To say this movie is STACKED with notable faces would be an understatement; the amazing thing is most of these people pop into the film for a scene or two and often, have extremely memorable moments in their own right. Florence Pugh's scenes are jarring, seductive, and sometimes disturbing, but I felt she was so crucial to the narrative. Emily Blunt playing Kitty Oppenheimer wasn't super impressive to me...until her incredible scene with Jason Clark during the questioning. My God, were they on fire there. Josh Hartnett pops in and brings that ""all-American boy"" pathos to the film and he's absolutely excellent. I could go on and on about all the actors in this movie, some very famous, who clearly just enjoyed the opportunity working with Nolan.If there was one performance I really disliked though, it was Gary Oldman as Harry Truman. Not only did he not really sound or look like him, but it was a rare ""over performance"" for this guy, who typically is fantastic as a character actor. I felt he was jarring and super distracting.I loved this film's cinematography, especially towards the end. There are so many iconic, visually stunning moments that stuck with me days after watching the film (i.e. Oppenheimer walking down the hallway, the entire assembly scene). But it's also interesting how overall, this film is very laid back and small scale (despite dealing with highly weighty themes), and will probably disappoint some expecting Nolan bombast. I personally didn't mind, but I would've been okay with a scene or two exploring the context of WHY the atomic bomb seemed necessary (*cough* my male brain wants some WW II action scenes for the IMAX *cough*).I also really liked how the film dealt with the politics and zeitgeist of the era; if you're fascinated by World War II and the early Cold War, as I am, you are in for a feast of references that only a history nerd could appreciate. It really captures what the time was like and how complicated our past really was. This is a movie that deliberately eschews the Great Man theory of history, instead putting Oppenheimer squarely within a social and political context that, even if he tries, he can never control or be above.But, I hope that instead of rolling your eyes and saying ""it was boring, it was confusing,"" it prompts audience curiosity and gets people to try and understand the history for themselves. Nolan does a tremendous job of distilling a complex man and a complex era into a historical epic; I really have to commend the man for having the confidence to make a 3 hour long, dialog heavy historical drama in the middle of summer, and have it be a BLOCKBUSTER.They don't make many Christopher Nolans anymore. Protect this man at all costs.",8,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer is a uniquely told biopic about the man and team that created the nuclear bomb.Starting with the positives: Cilian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Need to get an Oscar nomination for these performances. The sound, score and cinematography are impeccable. The detonation scene will go down in history for one of the greatest scenes ever, and Nolan deserves the nomination for that alone. I have never felt more thrilled and captivated than in this scene. The silence in the filled theatre gave me chills. The theatre experience is a must to fully enjoy this film. I don't think it would give the same effect watching it at home.The film was very timely considering our current political climat on AI and the impact of technology on humanity. I enjoyed the criticism of the American Nationalism, and the way they portrayed Oppenheimer's gilt. That scene in the auditorium with the people loudly stomping their feet was a masterpiece. I just wish the film was more like that than the rest of this mess.The film starts off strong with the characterization of Oppenheimer by showcasing his obsession with physics. They introduce these complex topics easily enough for the audience, but I'll need a 2nd watch to understand all the political parts. However, the first act's editing is a bit clunky. The scenes are cut too short, and it makes it difficult to follow the story, and care for the characters. New faces would constantly appear, and it would get confusing to understand their purpose to the narrative. This gets me to Florence Pugh which was critically underused. Her character was underdeveloped, and I would personally have cut her out of the film to leave more space for Emily Blunt's character. We get that one scene towards the end with her that was good, but it was hard to care since we barely got to know her. The film barely passes the Bechdall test, and leaves a lot to be desired from the female characters that all fell flat. It bewilders me to see how we got to know so little of the characters in a 3+ hour film.Focusing on communism and the courtroom drama was important for the story, but there was too much of it. I don't see how Robert Downey Jr's character was so present. I don't think he should have been a focus, even if I think it was an excellent performance. It left me wanting more on the critique of this invention, and the impact it had on the characters. I think archival footage of Hiroshima would have pertinent, in addition to scenes that speculated more on the character's feelings towards the ethics of this bomb.The final scene is what makes this film so haunting. The decision to add Einstein and to bring back this critical dialogue scene is probably why so many love this film. It leaves you with this twisted feeling, and somewhat of an open ending that is meant to spark discussion. Overall, there are some excellent moments in this film, but it sadly doesn't take the spot of my favourite Nolan film.",8,Oppenheimer
"It's only the middle of summer and we are almost half a year before the Academy nominations, but I think we already have one of the serious contenders for collecting many of the 2024 awards in Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer'. It's the kind of movies adored by American audiences and critics alike, the story of a great American adventure and the biography of a personality who made history. The biographical docu-drama brings to the screen the life story of the scientist who led the Manhattan Project and raises questions relevant then and relevant today about the responsibilities of scientists and the risks of research and technological achievements put at the service of militaries and governments. The cast features an impressive gallery of Hollywood stars, and the special effects sprinkled throughout the film give it an extra dimension of appeal (and a Nolan touch). There are also plenty of political drama aspects, but ultimately the main qualities of this film, the ones that will remain after the initial excitement wears off, are related to the extremely truthful and well-documented portraits of the personalities who contributed to the success of the Manhattan Project.The story in 'Oppenheimer' is structured in three temporal planes that unfold in parallel with dizzying speed. The biographical plot begins in the 1920s, Oppenheimer's years of study in Europe, and ends in the months after the end of World War II and the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The staged 1954 investigation into a secret committee aimed at denying the scientist, who had become uncomfortable by his pacifist political views, an extension of security clearance to allow him access to and collaboration with US nuclear programs constitutes the second level. Finally, the 1958 public hearings for the Senate confirmation of the politician Lewis Strauss - initially a supporter, later a personal enemy of Oppenheimer and the main person responsible for his downfall - represent the third plan. The second and third levels provide the flashbacks that recreate the first. Throughout the development of the biography are interspersed short and spectacular images that visually project Oppenheimer's thoughts: the mysteries related to the structure of the universe on a sub-atomic scale and on a cosmic scale in the first part of the film and the nightmares of destruction during the dawn of the atomic age. The result is a three-hour film in which the sequences often follow one another with the rapidity of video editing, while in other cases, long, documentary-like scenes record the endless debates in secret or public commissions. Color and black and white alternate to give the feeling of authenticity. 'Oppenheimer' seems like an encyclopedia of editing styles, but all adapted to the purpose. Spectacular, even impressive at times, but not easy to watch.Do we understand Robert Oppenheimer, those around him and the era they lived in better after watching this film? Probably yes, in some ways, but not completely though. The book that inspired the film, 'American Prometheus', one of the many biographies and science books written about the scientist, has over 700 pages. Some aspects of the scientist's enrollment in the program, personal life and collaboration with his contemporaries are well rendered, others are treated superficially or completely ignored, such as those related to Oppenheimer's Jewish identity or his decisions to abandon fundamental scientific research in favor of the managerial practicalities of the military program (for this reason Oppenheimer never received a Nobel Prize). Cillian Murphy got into the character's mind and soul perfectly. The gallery of actors around him played their roles with precision: Robert Downey Jr. In the complex role of Lewis Strauss; Matt Damon as an excellent General Groves, Oppenheimer's military partner; Benny Safdie - very accurate and expressive as Edward Teller, Oppenheimer's rival (except for the biographical detail that Teller limped because of an accident in his youth, a detail omitted in the film); Gary Oldman with one single but memorable scene as President Harry Truman. The scenes that take place at Los Alamos during the work on the project and especially in the days and hours leading up to the first atomic explosion are formidable. The dilemmas of Oppenheimer and of his colleagues regarding nuclear weapons and the race between superpowers that has led to the balance of nuclear terror and the possibility of the destruction of all life on the planet are well brought to the screen. My feeling was that some of the aspects of American domestic politics are presented in too much detail and get lost, especially given the length and pace of the narrative. I have read some reviews where it is mentioned that details missed initially can be noticed or understood better on a second viewing. That would be true with many movies, but most moviegoers can't afford or don't want to watch a three-hour movie twice (or more!) times. I think that in this case two hours more filtered to the essentials would have been a more suitable format. 'Oppenheimer' is a remarkable film in many ways, but in this case I don't believe that size added quality or depth.",8,Oppenheimer
"The actual story needed to be told. But it would have been better a 2 hour linear docudrama, than a 3 hour mysterious storytelling adventure where the director keeps us in his thrall with his cutting, and his use of color to depict time. The science, which is actually the most important character in the story, is almost totally excluded. The scenes meant to describe fission processes, were not related to fission at all. Dark stars aren't relevant. Neither is the physics of how stars work, because stars work by fusion, and this is a story about fission. The atomic bomb was inevitable, given the continuing discoveries by nuclear physicists. A few years There was a time, shortly before the Manhattan project was funded, the we didn't know if it could work, theoretically. But that wasn't made a part of the Oppenheimer story. Churchill's refusal to share with the Russians thru into the Cold War sill are threatened by.",8,Oppenheimer
"Barbenheimer is deemed this year's biggest cinematic event, and the two distinct films have both exceeded my personal expectations. More than I hoped for- Oppenheimer is a gripping, intense psychological drama. While not for the faint of heart and sometimes hard to watch, it is sure a film that is to change our modern cinematic Hollywood landscape. Oppenheimer's striking, unique filmmaking techniques, effects, and cinematography leaves viewers in awe or shock while truthfully aiding in the storytelling. Although the storytelling and structure is non-linear, I found it not too difficult to follow along to and carefully and cleverly crafted. The sound design of the film is phenomenal and sometimes unexpected (in a remarkably sensational way that shifts perspectives of events). Ludwig Göransson's soundtrack was absolutely essentially to the dramatization of the story and events. The stellar screenplay and performances truly shined through Nolan's insane direction of the film. Although the first act felt a bit slow at times, I was blown away by the film at the end and was left wanting more, hoping it would not end. Oppenheimer revealed more depth than I imagined by exploring the leading character's moral dilemmas and the effects of the political landscape at the time. While not necessarily for all ages or types of audiences, Oppenheimer is fresh, absorbing, notable, and must be seen in the theaters on the big screen.",8,Oppenheimer
"I entered the movie theatre expecting a great movie about the nuclear bomb and its impact on Oppenheimer, but no, it was actually about Oppenheimer and his impact on himself and the world around him.The Best biography film I have ever seen, the best Nolan movie and more importantly the best of this year.Every character is well served and all got a great drama, influence, and performances.If Cilian Murphy didn't get his Oscar this year it will be one of the greatest crimes in the history of the academy awards that exceeds the crime of not nominating Jake Gyllinhal for Best Actor on his role in Nightcrawler.RDJ didn't lie when he said that's the best film he has been in and he had his best performance too and my man made Zodiac!I was shocked by Emily blunt as I bever thought she got that performance in her.Florence Pugh's character maybe is not what I expected, she didn't get to show us her incredible performance that we used to see it as her screentime was incredibly short, and her drama isn't served so well yet so influential.I stongly recommend this movie for any film fans, and if you could attend this movie in IMax theaters u will have the best experience ever as the music pumps in your heart.",9,Oppenheimer
"Christopher Nolan, known for his technical brilliance, delves into the biographical genre for the first time with ""Oppenheimer."" putting a unique spin on the portrayal of the legendary figure. One notable aspect of Nolan's directorial style is his ability to focus on characters and their emotions. Similarly, he successfully attempts to depict the complex character of Oppenheimer, who, in reality, had two distinct sides.The first aspect celebrates Oppenheimer's role as the creator of the most powerful weapons known to mankind, while the second part sheds light on his realization that humanity now possesses the capability to potentially destroy the entire planet. Classic Nolan handles this duality of Oppenheimer's character amazingly, making the movie a thought-provoking experience for those who appreciate historical biographies and the moral dilemmas they present.Coming to the acting, I must say it's a masterpiece! The fusion of top-notch actors is exceptional, and everyone seamlessly belongs to that era. Cillian Murphy is absolutely perfect for the role; he elevates the film to new heights with his phenomenal performance, making it a true cinematic gem that will be remembered for years to come. And RDJ, his new avatar and performance solidifies the film's status as a cinematic gem. Their performances together are simply extraordinary, adding an unforgettable layer of brilliance to the movie.In summary, ""Oppenheimer"" may not appeal to everyone, but for science enthusiasts and history buffs, it offers a compelling and emotionally engaging cinematic experience.Nolan's masterful direction and the portrayal of Oppenheimer's complex character make this movie a worthwhile watch for those intrigued by historical and scientific narratives.",9,Oppenheimer
"Might sound absolutely blasphemous but I think this is better watched at home. This is not against the quality of the filmmaking, which was understandably amazing but the tediousness of it being an unintentional Oscar bait. There are tooo many characters, most looking similar and too dialogue heavy to be watching in theatres. The soundmixing leaves a lot of the dialogue to the imagination as well. What I expected from it was not what I walked away with, this is not about the bomb rather than the political side of the bomb. So be prepared to sit through endless courtroom back-and-forth with characters introduced in almost every scene. If you are not already aware of exactly what happened to Oppenheimer esp his life after the bomb, you're gonna have a really hard time understanding whats going on. Thats where the paradox lies, can it be a masterfully crafted movie if you lose your audience before the credits? Because it absolutely is and most around me absolutely were. And then if you are already aware of everything that happened to Oppenheimer was it really necessary to play the plot twist game with a certain character throughout the entire movie? The whole movie was a bit of oxymoron, you get to see what you prolly didnt want to and didnt get to see what you most wanted to. I'm talking about the bomb obviously, I was heavily disappointed by the absence of it. The saving grace was the amazing acting performance by RDJ and Emily Blunt who both should be receiving Oscar nominations. Cillian Murphy did a great job as well but there were many scenes where I felt like I was watching Tommy Shelby instead of Robert Oppenheimer. The best part of watching Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer was when he had no dialogues because his eyes do a better job at portraying what Nolan was going for. There is surprisingly little of the Nolan ""practical effect mindbending scene that needs to be seen in cinemas"". This was easier to follow and harder to watch than TENET.RATING: 7.5/10.",7,Oppenheimer
"One scene in ""Oppenheimer"" kept my interest: the test detonation of the atomic bomb at Los Alamos. It's a testament to Christopher Nolan's skill as a director of action set pieces that he was able to make this moment almost unbearably suspenseful. After all, it's not exactly a spoiler to reveal that the test works.Unfortunately, that moment is preceded and followed by scene after scene after scene of old white men bickering and whining, turning Nolan's film into a bit of a boring slog, and a ridiculously long one at that. This film didn't need to be three hours long, and only is so that Nolan fans can convince themselves that it's yet another of his ""important"" masterpieces and justify paying exorbitant prices to see it in IMAX. Why anyone would want to see this movie in IMAX is a puzzle to me, since the whole thing is mostly just dudes standing around in brown offices talking.Thank god for Emily Blunt, who gets one scene where she finally shuts up all the men blathering around her. And Cillian Murphy deserves some credit for doing pretty well with the material he's given, though I took issue with the way the movie turns Oppenheimer into a hero and those who were against him stock villains. Despite Nolan's reputation for making thinking man's movies, this is not one. It tells you at every moment exactly what you're supposed to be feeling and what you're supposed to think about any given situation.You know, our planet is literally burning down around us as a I write this comment. Whether or not we ever use nuclear weapons on each other seems almost irrelevant in the face of climate catastrophe. I just didn't have the patience for the self-importance dripping from this movie, both from the characters in it and the people who made it.It will of course be nominated for a bazillion Oscars, because people convinced themselves that it was a masterpiece before it even opened.Grade: B-",4,Oppenheimer
"This film is a true visual and intellectual masterpiece from Christopher Nolan. The film is a biography of the man's life from his time as a young academic right up until the atomic bomb creation and him losing his security clearance after the war. Cillian Murphy's portrayal is exceptional of a man who started off a misfit and became the most famous man in the world. There are different time lines in this film, that can confuse the viewer. If you pay attention and are interested in the subject matter this film with really assault the senses and the mind. Nolan created some exceptional visuals of the recreation of the atomic bomb Trinity test in the desert in New Mexico. The other performances were also outstanding. Florence Pugh was great also and the sexy lover of Oppenheimer. She oozes sex appeal and portrays her character with emotional depth, for a woman who had mental health issues.Robert Downey Jnr as Strauss who helped Oppenheimer with the Manhattan Project but then tried to take him down after the war. He may have given the performance of his career. I loved the visuals and the black cinematography at times, used with colour as well. I loved the set design, the costumes and the classic style cars. I could go on and on about how great I think this movie is and I can't wait to see it again. Nolan has created a 3 hour epic about a man who grappled with changing the course of human history. I hope this film gets many Oscar nominations and I think it is the best film of the year so far.",9,Oppenheimer
"Those complaining about this film not passing the Bechdel Test and being too boring, would make the same complaints about the classic 12 Angry Men. Those complaining about the nudity in this film have completely missed the point. The film shows Oppenheimer as a slightly awkward person who used his intelligence as his charm with women. The first sex scene was as expected, slightly awkward almost like the first time you lose your virginity. In the book, Oppenheimer, experienced abusive pressure from his mother in who he should date. The first sex scene is them barley nude with her in-control and dominating him. The later is them both equally comfortable and fully exposed to their core with each other. Like the bomb he's building...they're drawn together, attracted to each other, and when connected sensational things happen, but they're destructive to each other and to those around them. The fact we're still talking about it, proves it was a psychologically effective visual of seeing Oppenheimer and his mistress both on top of each other in that hearing room with Emily Blunt staring directly into her eyes. It's about exposure, to their core, and then to the world.Also, Cillian Murphy showed more nudity in 28 Days Later than in this...grow up.Back in the early 90s, Oliver Stone made a profoundly engaging political thriller, JFK. One of the best films of all-time, and one of the best film edits of all-time. The fact that Oppenheimer gave me vibes of Oliver Stone's JFK, speaks volumes of this epic opus from one of the few directors in Hollywood who audiences can still count on to make an above average film and not sell out to cheap gimmicks. Also, to hardcore Nolan fans, this is not Inception 2 or the next Dark Knight feature. Nolan has taken another larger step in the world of cinematic storytelling.Christopher Nolan has made some of the greatest films in his career. The Dark Knight, Inception, Momento, and Dunkirk. Despite The Dark Knight being one of my all-time favorites, Oppenheimer might just be Nolan's masterpiece of storytelling cinema. Oppenheimer, is not an action pack thrill ride like The Dark Knight and Inception. It's not a insane, complicated narrative like Tenet. Not drowning in complex science like Interstellar. It's not a simple story/history recount with minimal character focus like Dunkirk. Nope, Oppenheimer is Nolan's adaptation of the book American Prometheus, and the source material makes this one of Nolan's best screenplays for him to work off of. This is the most fascinating dive and study of a character I have seen in a Nolan film to date. However, when the film is intense, it's gripping. For a 3 hour film, it's never boring or jarring. Its non-linear editing, sparking JFK vibes, keeps your engagement fully tuned, and leaves you enthralled from each scene. Oppenheimer sparks the dark conspiring thriller notes of JFK, with the mathematical background of A Beautiful Mind, and with a Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life style approach.Cillian Murphy gives a career high performance amongst an absolutely astonishing cast which includes phenomenal performances from Robert Downy Jr, Emily Blunt, and even a fantastic returning performance from Josh Hartnet. Even the back end of the cast features multiple Oscar winners. Gary Oldman, Casey Affleck, Kenneth Branagh, and Rami Malek. Along with several other talented named actors.It's that great of a film and character study. Take away Nolan's name from the film and I would still say this. The man who ended WWII, saving possibly millions of lives by ending hundreds of thousands of lives, only to feel guilt and then allow the world to shame him for his controversial gifted brilliance. There is a lot to take from Oppenheimer. In a pretty lackluster year, Oppenheimer is already and easily the film to beat.",10,Oppenheimer
"Some of the things I think are good about this movie:
Nolan's approach of CGI minimalism.The awesome acting by its cast members, I especially think Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and Jason Clarke as the highlights of the actingFantastic choice of B&W/color scenesHaunting and awesome score by Ludwig GöranssonThe dialogues that represent the politics, dilemmas, dissent, and scientific discussions that go behind the Trinity testBut I can't help but to feel that something feels incomplete/off about the pacing and portrayal in the movie, it feels like some scenes are too lengthy and sort of dominate other aspects of the story that should have gotten more screen time instead. I mean, don't get me wrong, this movie is awesome and it definitely immerses people into Oppenheimer's great and tragic life story and shows how important of a person he was, but it feels like there is an imbalance in the storytelling and how long things are told. It feels like considering the significance of the story of Oppenheimer, there is something that feels imbalanced in the film.",9,Oppenheimer
"I read the book on which the movie was based, and this film is exactly as I imagined it, and it was almost perfect yet as good as it will ever get.Nolan skipped some of my favorite parts of the story and narrative, but he kept the important ones and those that were significant to Oppies' personal life.I'm pretty sure that this film will get mixed reviews because it is definitely not for everyone because it is so dialogue-heavy, and to get the right picture of the narrative, you'll pretty much have to listen carefully to every single word that is said in the film. Second of all, I think the film might be confusing because of its constant shifting between three continuous storylines that take place years apart from one another.I certainly hope this film will be a wake-up call for the masses about how a war in the present is way deadlier than prior to the historical events that the film depicts.",9,Oppenheimer
"Oh my god... where do i even start !!Cillian Murphy was the best casting for Oppenheimer. He portrayed him perfectly. The other castings were great too !! So many familiar faces throughout. Emily Blunt did a fantastic job playing Kitty. AND ROBERT DOWNEY JR AS LEWIS ?? Amazing. Absolutely amazing.This is a film that you definitely need to watch in the cinema; or at least with surround sound. Because the atmosphere is intense !! The sounds of the bomb tests, the visions that Oppenheimer has. Wow.The vfx were incredible too !! The moments of silence, like during the bomb test or when Oppenheimer does a speech after the bombs are dropped on Japan, where we get into his head and feel what he's experiencing were done phenomenally.I can't wait for shows like the Oscars, because i can guarantee that this film will wipe the board.",9,Oppenheimer
"I went into the movie with high expectations and overall it did deliver well.Pros: special effects, story, acting, casting, cinematography, soundtrack/music, ending was well doneCons: the beginning was a little messy for me, the audio for the dialogue could've been clearer - it was hard to heard several scenes, the writing for female characters in the story could've been strongerI do think Nolan missed a few good opportunities in terms of making this movie a masterpiece, but the acting by all the actors, the special effects and the story will be remembered by many viewers for years to come.",8,Oppenheimer
"A film like Oppenheimer can easily be regarded as a well made film, but is not for everyone. Rating it based on filmmaking, then it's a 10 and that's where I will stay personally, too. Certainly there are things that could be changed to ""make it better"", but the decisions that were made by Nolan were the correct ones narratively.The purpose of the film is not about creating the bomb, but its true intentions, other than being focused on Oppenheimer, are not truly revealed until the third act. The characters and their ideals drive the plots forward in a very interesting way. Revealing how people, especially the physicist and scientists, act in this place and time fits the structure of the story to a T. We don't need to know the direction that the film is going since we already know the end. Who Oppenheimer is and how he communicates with those around him is all the audience needs for the first hour and the next hour, dealing with the bomb, is paid off dramatically based on our personal experience with these characters. There's a lot of plot, but not much story, which is exactly what this film needed.By the time we get to the true meaning of the film and why it's told as a drama rather than a documentary is realized in its third act. It's a human story that will make you question history and not so much the ""how"" of the bomb, but the ""why"". The 3 hour journey is a completely original experience. It's an audio and visual experience that doesn't let go of its audience. You will be forced to watch the movie at a high volume or with subtitles, but the payoff of a loud 3 hours spent with Oppenheimer is relentlessly rewarding. While it may not be for everyone, it is a film made perfectly for what Nolan was going for, and it's ""perfect"" for that reason alone.",10,Oppenheimer
"This is not a perfect movie. There are perfect movies in the sense that if you take something out of them or add something in, the movie will get worse. I think Memento for example, was a more perfect movie than this one, and to a certain extent so was Dark Knight. This does not make them better movies than this one; I think this movie is around the same level or better.This movie also is not an action movie or a cookie cutter thriller or whatever passes for entertainment nowadays in our low IQ society. In a way this is a gem in the sea of cr4p that is produced by the current culture of today. It's a thoughtful work of art. If I could never have watched any Marvel movie and watched this instead I'd do it in a heartbeat.",9,Oppenheimer
"Telling the story of a larger-than-life individual truly calls for a larger-than-life film, and that's precisely what writer-director Christopher Nolan has come up with in his latest feature outing, handily the best work of his career. Nolan's three-hour opus about the life of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), director of the Manhattan Project (and more commonly known as the Father of the Atomic Bomb), provides viewers with a comprehensive biography of this brilliant and thoughtful yet often-inscrutable and naïve physicist who took on a patently dangerous venture that left him morally conflicted about the nature of his creation. The story, which spans several decades of the scientist's life, chronicles his development of ""the gadget"" and the fallout he suffered as a consequence of his left-wing political leanings and his efforts to keep the released nuclear genie from getting out of control. The film is admittedly a little overlong and probably could have used some editing in the opening and final hour, but, in the interest of telling the whole story of Oppenheimer's odyssey, its length is understandable (and, consequently, justifiable). The picture's production values are all top shelf, especially its brilliant cinematography, stirring original score and superb sound quality, an element that truly leaves audiences with a bona fide visceral experience. Moreover, the narrative is skillfully and eloquently brought to life by this offering's outstanding ensemble cast, including Murphy, Matt Damon, Tom Conti, Benny Safdie, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Gary Oldman, Rami Malek, and, especially, Robert Downey Jr., who delivers a stellar, award-worthy supporting performance showing acting chops that I never knew he possessed. ""Oppenheimer"" is easily the best film of the summer movie season, if not all of 2023 thus far. It packs a potent punch and delivers a message that we can all never hear too often, poignantly reminding us all of the importance of not falling prey to the same Promethean burden that Oppenheimer was forced to shoulder.",7,Oppenheimer
"This movies is not about making bombs or awesome explosion scenes. It's about limp-wristed scientists and aristocrats pointing the finger at each for being communists. They barely talk about bombs at all and when they do it's vague and cuts immediately. If you want go see iMax screens of people's faces arguing who's a communist and who's not this movie is for you, if you were expecting something like Interstellar I apologize. On the other hand if you ignore what I said and can enjoy the acting and cinematography then by all means go for it. This can still be a great movie, I just went in with very wrong expectations.",5,Oppenheimer
"Nolan rarely does empathy well but this is a soulless three hours of men mumbling at one another. Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt are wasted and portrayed as damaged souls. Scenes come and go barely registering on your conscience. Watching this movie is a bit like thinking back to you time in school where you were forced by your teachers to watch educational videos which were kind of okay but you'd rather be playing Lego or riding your bike. That's what watching Oppenheimer is like. It's like a three hour lecture with a bit of sex thrown in. Yes, it's a competent artistic film but that doesn't mean it's that good.",9,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer was one of the most disturbingly deep and real movies I have ever seen. It took a dive into imagination and growth, social and political turmoil, the unstoppable human struggle for achievement, ethics of power, and the terrible reality of fear and aspiration. I expected a film focused on the bomb itself with Oppenheimer's life as a small support. I'm glad I was wrong. This movie showed the full story. The good, the bad, and the ugly truth of life of Oppenheimer and everyone around him. Everything makes sense now. After decades important things lose their significance and seem to be mundane but I'm genuinely amazed and afraid of what humanity can do now.",9,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer, a breathtaking three-hour marvel, undoubtedly represents Christopher Nolan's magnum opus as a director. Throughout the film, the audience is seamlessly drawn into the protagonist's journey, becoming emotionally invested in every decision he makes. Divided into three major set pieces, the narrative gracefully unfolds, chronicling his ascent, the arduous path to achieving the unimaginable and earning the mantle of an American hero, and finally, confronting the impact of his legacy as history smirks on.The cast's performances are exceptional, each actor embodying their roles with poise and excellence, making it hard to distinguish them from their on-screen personas. However, it is Cilian Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer that adds an extraordinary layer to the story. His compelling performance captures the essence of the character, allowing the audience to feel the struggles and downfall of this enigmatic figure.Nolan's storytelling prowess shines throughout, guiding viewers on an unforgettable cinematic journey, leaving a profound impact. Oppenheimer is not merely a film; it's an immersive experience that lingers in the minds and hearts of its audience long after the credits roll. A testament to exceptional storytelling and outstanding acting, Oppenheimer cements its place as a cinematic triumph and a remarkable addition to Christopher Nolan's illustrious filmography.",9,Oppenheimer
"Let's be honest here. This isn't your average World War II film; filled with violent war scenes and American nationalistic themes.This is a slow-building biopic about one man's genius being imparted on one of the most noteworthy endeavors of the 20th century - The Manhattan Project, which resulted in the atomic bomb.Oppenheimer is well-produced, well-acted and beautifully shot. Cillian Murphy emits the perfect disturbed look that Oppenheimer has become famous for, and the attention to detail surrounding his character is on point.The only negative aspect of Oppenheimer is how much it can demand your attention. Because it's so rich, it's very easy to miss something important. If you miss a few details about the intricacies of the story it can ruin the immersion. However, the second time through makes it much more understandable.All in all, this is a solid Nolan movie and a great addition to his ever-growing library of classics.",9,Oppenheimer
"Well! Oppenheimer is excellent! Certainly lives up to the hype.All Nolan films are haunting, haunted, and different. Oppenheimer is in the mould. Cilian Murphy is centre stage here and he is brilliant! Oscar I think? He is centre stage - but he doesn't carry the movie. The cast is strong and acting excellent. Photography - excellent, beautiful - especially in New Mexico. Story and storytelling - excellent. This is a great movie!Why only 9/10, and not 10/10??? For me, a film has to be able to live with the very best in order to get a 10. Although Oppenheimer is excellent - it wasn't quite up there, wasn't quite what I was expecting. That can be fine - don't have to always get what you expect! But here, the female characters are not well framed. Emily Blunt is a brilliant actress - but she deserved better than her horrible little cameo. There is another female character who gets even worse treatment, and one final one who gets 15 seconds on the screen. But that's it!Although the soundtrack is superb - it's overpowering and obtrusive. That's a real shame.Even so, Oppenheimer is powerful. There are a lot of characters - it's tricky to keep up. The timelines jump around too - but that's just one of Nolan's normal tricks. Go and see it and see what you think.",9,Oppenheimer

"Oppenheimer is being treated as if it is another Christopher Nolan Film Bro Prestige Blockbuster. The semi-sarcastic viral marketing has sold it as the male answer to Greta Gerwig's Film Sis blockbuster, Barbie. And wouldn't it be nice if Nolan's much-anticipated new film was the next in the line of mind-bending action epics that have given the director his ""must see"" cred. But, for better or worse, Oppenheimer is a long, long way from The Dark Knight, Inception, Interstellar, Dunkirk, or Tenet.This new film is something very heavy, very serious, and very grandiose. It shares those qualities with much of Nolan's signature pictures. However, those buying a ticket for Oppenheimer expecting filmic thunder and lightning and spectacular visual scope will be let down by what the film actually is. In effect, Oppenheimer is something almost uncomfortably intimate. The subject is Robert Oppenheimer, brilliant scientist, leader of The Manhattan Project and Father of the Atomic Bomb. Cillian Murphy inhabits the character handily. It's the role of a lifetime for Murphy, one of those miracles of casting where an actor who has put in great work over the course of a career is rewarded with a part that will define him for all-time. It's an inward performance, emphasizing internal struggles-not only Oppenheimer's moral dilemma in creating the bomb to end all wars, but his personal tribulations and the political pressure that had closed in on him in the post-war years. He makes superb use of his physical look; utilizing those sunken eyes and gaunt frame with face and body language that illustrates inner uncertainty. You couldn't have asked for a better melding of actor, material, and performance.In its 3 hours, Oppenheimer zeros in on the development of the atomic bomb, from the early scientific breakthroughs that made it possible to the military strategy involved, the questions of security, fears of espionage, and the political repercussions of its ultimate detonation. It is a movie entirely made up of critically important conversations, and for that reason, it is an actor's dream project. The lineup here is about as good as it gets in this star-starved Hollywood era. Robert Downey Jr. Is the revelation of the cast as Lewis Strauss, a mysterious figure who lurks on the peripheries of the story until coming into startling focus in the third act. It is easily the best acting of RDJ's career, and an incredible reassurance of his talents after a string of bad performances in bad movies. The supporting cast is unusually stacked with big-name actors doing the type of stuff they got into the business for. Emily Blunt ought to earn an Oscar nomination for her work as Oppenheimer's fed up alcoholic second wife, looking unattractive and coming off as an unpleasant burnout. Matt Damon also redeems his recent misfires with some strong, modulated energy. The bit parts are too many and too good to earn anyone special recognition, but Kenneth Branagh, Jason Clarke, Josh Harnett, Dane DeHaan, Casey Affleck, and Gary Oldman in a single unforgettable scene, are joys to watch.The most apt comparison for Oppenheimer's urgent, dialogue driven feel is Oliver Stone's JFK. The experience of watching the film is similar; you are caught in the grip of these discussions, and the director, in both cases, doesn't give you space to check out. ""Pay attention to what these people are saying. The fate of the world is on the line."" Nolan makes that energy work, although not with quite the level of craft that Stone showed in his film. Of course, as writer, Nolan can't resist time-jumping between Congressional hearings and science lectures and political machinations, but thankfully these mixed-up threads (some presented in black-and-white) make dramatic sense and sharpen the impact of the film's ending.Oppenheimer is a better written film than it is directed. That's new territory for Christopher Nolan, who has made a career out of endowing basically intelligent action movies with grand visual might. He doesn't do much to amaze us here. His best visual ideas come in the form of recurring symbolic images such as ripples in a puddle, marbles in a glass, or the nuclear chain reaction of the bomb itself. These are simple ideas that convey great meaning. All very deft and powerful. What you don't get is spectacle. The suspense that is built up so intensely before the Trinity test, is let out somewhat underwhelmingly when the bomb is finally dropped. It's a big explosion that sort of looks like a nuke. My jaw remained right where it was. This movie is playing on IMAX screens, and I did see it on a large-format, but there is no real advantage to that presentation.We're so starved for serious adult movies in the 2020s Hollywood landscape that even a less-than-triumphant attempt is a treasure that must be supported. I could sit here and tell you that Oppenheimer is a really ""talky"" movie, and one that doesn't quite teach us about some of the truly fascinating scientific aspects of the atomic bomb (I was never sure of exactly how Oppenheimer's previous work translated to the Manhattan Project, or why splitting the atom was such an important stepping stone), but there is no way I'm not going to urge people to see this film. Here is the good stuff we film buffs talk about. They don't make idea-driven mega-blockbusters about real people in the real world, but every so often one slips through. See it and savor the high.85/100.",9,Oppenheimer
"The movie is long at the 3 hours, but it doesn't seem that way. Cillian Murphy looks very much like Oppenheimer in this. Did you know that he ate only one almond and water for weeks to lose the weight? I worry about actors who do stuff like that - many doctors think it is dangerous. His performance is excellent, I am sure that an Oscar nomination will be forthcoming. But the highlight for me in acting was Robert Downey, Jr. As Lewis Strauss, the former head of the Atomic Energy Commision who developed a deep hatred for Oppenheimer on a perceived slight at a hearing. And he was suspicious of Oppenheimer communist ties - he teamed up with Edward Teller, who was angry with Oppenheimer because of Oppenheimer's opposition to the H-bomb to wreck Oppenheimer's professional life. At least so far this year, I think Downey is a shoo-in for a best supporting actor Oscar. The movie is filled with many other fine actors, including Rami Malek (""Mr. Robot"") who has a relatively small but key role in the hearings on Strauss. Emily Blunt is very good as Oppenheimer's wife but the highlight from the female acting performance for me is Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock. My only casting complaint is Matt Damon as General Leslie Groves; Groves was a beefy, gruff man, I don't think Damon fills that bill - the late, great Brian Dennehy would have been perfect. Surely there is a similar actor out there. The movie is filled with half of Hollywood it seems, including Alden Ehrenreich, Dane DeHaan, and Josh Hartnett. It is the must-see movie of the year or even the decade!",9,Oppenheimer
"9/10. Christopher Nolan proves once again that he is one of the most prolific filmmakers of our time. This biographical drama is brilliantly crafted, epic in scope, and has powerful storytelling anchored with a very well-rounded cast. The way he crafts this film on a terrifying subject is beautiful and intense.The sound design is hard hitting and awesomely loud. Yes, you can hear most of dialogue and doesn't get drowned out like it did in ""Tenet"". Ludwig Goransson creates a haunting soundtrack to help the film feel alive and horrifying.Cillian Murphy is mesmerizing in his powerhouse performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer. His acting is very expressive with his facial expressions and mannerisms. Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, and especially Robert Downey Jr. Are all standouts as well. Hoyte van Hoytema cinematography is a wonderful sight to behold. They shot this with Imax cameras on real film as opposed to the overused digital format. Nolan wants you to experience this in the theater the way it's meant to be. Kodak also invented the first ever black and white Imax film for this movie.It's not a completely perfect film. It does run for about three hours long, but it's well earned. It's a slow burn, densely filled drama that will turn off some of the mainstream movie goers. Some of the other big-name stars have a limited amount of screentime. Hopefully, this will be one of the front runners for the Oscars. Nolan painted a wonderful picture about the birth of nuclear warfare, atomic bombs, fear, death, and the possibility of destroying the earth.So now it's time to give Nolan his long, overdue Oscar for directing. How he wasn't even nominated for ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Inception"" is baffling.",6,Oppenheimer
"You have one of the greatest scientific achievements in history and you use it as a background for a boring courtroom drama?So much if the film is Oppenheimer feeling guilty and conflicted, like that's some fresh take on the situation. When it's a given.Nolan also goes back to all his typical tricks - jumping around the timeline, 1-dimensional women, needless nudity, and an overbearing soundtrack. Showing he has not grown as a Director/Writer at all.Cillian Murphy seemed to struggle in the role, he comes across as very bored and his character doesn't feel like a genus at any part of the film.A lot of the big names take you out of the film, but all the other scientists in smaller roles played their parts well.It's an ok film, but they should've focused on making the bomb, like the trailer implies.",2,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer, directed by Christopher Nolan, is a gripping and morally complex film that explores the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scientist behind the atomic bomb. Nolan expertly weaves together a multi-layered narrative, using a blend of color and black-and-white scenes, to depict Oppenheimer's personal and professional milestones, including his involvement in the Manhattan Project. While the film delves deep into the bomb building process, it refrains from showing the actual bombings. Instead, it focuses on the lingering consequences and ethical implications of nuclear weaponry. The movie's brilliance lies in its ability to put Oppenheimer's story into a larger context. It showcases the intersection of science, politics, and personal struggles during an age of transformational scientific discovery.As the film progresses, Nolan masterfully navigates through Oppenheimer's life, revealing his complex character and the numerous relationships that shaped him. Oppenheimer, portrayed with fervent intensity by Cillian Murphy, is depicted as a polymath, an enigmatic man of contradictions, a womanizer, and a visionary scientist. He grapples with the immense moral implications of his work.The film's narrative structure is intricate and nonlinear, reflecting Oppenheimer's complexity and the era he lived in. Nolan uses his signature cinematic style, utilizing 65-millimeter film to create a sense of grandeur and monumentality that befits the historical significance of the events portrayed.Throughout the film, Oppenheimer's relationships with key figures such as Niels Bohr and Lewis Strauss are explored-this provides insights into his ideological struggles and the political forces at play during World War II and the ensuing Cold War. The film delves into Oppenheimer's friendships, romances, and involvement with leftist causes. These causes would later come under scrutiny during the McCarthy era anti-Communist fervor.Nolan's decision not to show the actual bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was wise and deliberate. This emphasizes Oppenheimer's ethical and moral dilemmas and the world at large. Instead, the film focuses on the aftermath of the bombings, the devastating consequences, and the arms race that followed. This creates a palpable sense of dread and reflection on nuclear weapons' destructive power.Nolan maintains the fast pace and fragmented narrative as he paints this abstract portrayal, weaving across continents and introducing a myriad of excellently cast characters, including physicist Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) who had a role in the Manhattan Project. The film is packed with familiar faces like Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., and Gary Oldman. However, all of the spectacular casting may distract you from their characters and prevent immersion. Benny Safdie as Edward Teller, the hydrogen bomb inventor, fits perfectly. Rami Malek's talent felt wasted on a minor role, but it adds another recognizable name to the cast.As Oppenheimer nears its conclusion, the pace slows down and the black-and-white sequences become more prominent, emphasizing the trials and tribulations Oppenheimer faced during the McCarthy era, where his reputation and career were scrutinized due to his past communist associations. These sections culminate in a powerful synthesis of Oppenheimer's struggles and contributions. They showcase a man who both played a vital role in scientific progress and grappled with moral implications.In the end, Nolan's film leaves a profound impact, reminding the audience of humanity's fragility and the responsibility that comes with wielding immense power. Nolan skillfully weaves a complex narrative of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life, exploring his multi-faceted character and his pivotal role in the development of the atomic bomb, all while warning of the devastating consequences of unchecked scientific progress, resulting in an intellectually thrilling and morally compelling film.",9,Oppenheimer
"The reason this is only a 9 is simply because I have only watched it once. I have given 19 films a 10/10, including 3 Nolan films (Inception, The Dark Knight, and The Prestige.) I will probably end up changing this to a 10/10, but want to watch it one more time before I do bc I take a 10/10 rating very serious. Now lets get into the movie:It's another Christopher Nolan masterpiece. The acting, editing, cinematography, score, all engulfs you into the theater for an amazing experience. This should be the front runner for every Oscar. Especially Cillian Murphy as best leading. Anyone that has watched Peaky Blinders knows what he is capable of as an actor, well he got his chance to lead a blockbuster movie and he nailed it. The last act kind of drags on, to be fair it is a 3 hour movie, but the first 2 hours of the movie is absolute peak filmmaking. The pace combined with the score make for as good an experience you can have in a movie theater. My buddy and I couldnt go 10 minutes without tapping or looking at eachother in disbelief. I can rant about this film all day, but if I can get anything across it is that it lived up to the hype and then some. Everyone needs to see it, and see it in theaters. It is too big and loud to watch at home. I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did.",9,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer, the 2023 cinematic masterpiece, is an intellectually stimulating tour de force that delves deep into the historical, moral, and psychological complexities of one of the most influential figures of the twentieth century, J.

It encourages us to confront the tragic dichotomy between scientific achievements and their potential for destruction, urging viewers to contemplate the importance of ethical decision-making in the face of monumental challenges.In conclusion, Oppenheimer is an intellectually stimulating and emotionally moving film that transcends traditional biographical dramas. Stellar performances, masterful storytelling, and profound insights into the complexities of an exceptional mind make it an absolute must-watch. This cinematic masterpiece reaffirms the power of film as a medium to inspire intellectual discourse and introspection. Oppenheimer truly stands as a cinematic marvel deserving of its place in the annals of cinema.",9,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer was a horror drama that shows you how a humankind can destroy the world without thinking of its own kind.It was typical Nolan movie with brilliant cinematography, appealing visuals and BG score.Cillian was outstanding but Robert Downey Jr. Man He was extremely good, probably one of his finest work, loved his acting. Matt Damon also did a good job.It's not just about the invention of a destructive tool but also connect to the human nature how the man himself feels when he realizes what he's done.Nolan was imaginative, clever and at his best, he created a beautiful cinematic MASTERPIECE.",9,Oppenheimer
"This film is magnificent. In the hands of a lesser director I think this would have been average and a bit of a snorefest -potentially. Nolan never lets this happen with astounding score, crackling dialogue , flawless acting and the typical Nolan direction. There is never a dull moment. Also there's a real element of suspense/ tension that Nolan exudes which makes this biopic feel more like a suspenseful drama but never swaying away from documenting the self titled life story. If the film had ended at the bombing I think I would have given this one less star but the last 40 minutes post bombing is riveting cinema and elevates it to almost greatness. Is this Nolan's best film? Not for me but is never the less a fantastic achievement.",8,Oppenheimer
"In the movie, Oppenheimer is a professor in Leiden, The Netherlands. You can hear him speak 'Dutch' for a class of students, but everyone in our Dutch movie theatre mumbled 'what? What's he saying?' It was a fantasy language, and certainly not Dutch, not even German. I think making a movie about real events requires proper investigation and love for details. Therefore we thought it was irritating that the actor and director didn't check this scene with Dutchies. The movie was very long and there were lots of characters and names you had to remember, but the general warning and impact of human destruction power and balances of power was very clear and very frightening. The uncertainty whether the bomb would destroy the complete atmosphere, and that they took that risk: man, one day we will really destroy earth, one way or the other.",8,Oppenheimer
"Well, I'm not sure why everyone is criticising the movie when it's actually quite good.Few people are comparing this movie to Barbie because of their release dates being so close together. It should be emphasised that both are not comparable.The actor Cillian Murphy portraying Oppenheimer in the film was superbly portrayed by Nolan. The visuals that he created without using VFX or CG demonstrate Nolan's commitment to the film. All of the actors had outstanding performances, and the casting is excellent. The Subjective and Objective points of view of the characters were masterfully done in the screenplay. Everyone assumed that this was solely about the development of the atomic bomb, but in truth, Oppenheimer overcame his argument regarding his security clearance.Every segment of the audience should see this film.",9,Oppenheimer
"I was really taken by it. It is 3 hrs long but time flies fast when you watch it. Interesting, complelling and not too hard to follow but yeah you have to concentrate with all the dfferent names on scientists etc... A very strong biopic. Great actors. Gary Oldman, Robert Downey Jr and Matt Damon and many more. I would say Robert Downey Jr is the big star in this movie, but of course Cilian Murphy is magnetic too. I usually go for more relationship-oriented movies with strong psychological portaits so I was a little bit hesitant about this one. Action, Nolan.... not my cup of tea... I had my prejudies! But it's one cinematic experience and it is worth all the hype, unlike the Barbie movie.",9,Oppenheimer
"A solid film by Nolan but it is worth mentioning to some that if you're expecting action you will be tremendously disappointed. This is a biography of Oppenheimer that focuses on key moments of his life. What drove this movie for me was the top notch quality of acting and the sound/compositions which were instrumental in bringing out the drama within a lot of the dialogue and the acting chops throughout the movie. Please be warned that the overwhelming majority of this movie is dialogue.While both Interstellar and Inception were extremely deep films from Nolan(and in my opinion his best work), there was a popcorn quality about those films where you could loosen up and not take the experience too seriously and still find it entertaining. With Oppenheimer you better pay close attention to the dialogue and what's going on because you will be lost. With that being said it is rewarding getting a glimpse of the drama surrounding the development of nuclear weapons, some of the darkest times in human history. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer will be his defining role of a lifetime. The acting from the cast was flawless along with the brilliant sound editing. I expect this film will be force to be reckoned with at the Oscars.",7,Oppenheimer
"Like some of the director's other films, but this was a directorial and editing disaster. I saw the 70mm IMAX version, but the IMAX big-screen features were not used well in this film. It wasn't necessary to see it on a big screen. You would think the bomb scene would make use of the screen, but it was a dud.The film uses extensive flash-forwards and flashbacks, as well as black-and-white and color sequences. Both techniques were unnecessary and confusing, but that seems to be the current fad.The first hour and a half of the film is mostly about politics and investigators, which is not my interest in this story. I wanted to know about how the bomb was built. That part of the story takes up about an hour, and it was made as dull as possible. Then we are left with more investigations of people in small rooms for half an hour at the end.The script was mediocre, leaving not much for the actors to do. Some gratuitous sex was thrown in, for no reason that I could discern. The opening apple story likely never happened in real life. It's ridiculous to think so. Over 20 people at Los Alamos gave their lives in the process of making the bomb, and they aren't mentioned at all. Some died from radiation poisoning. Einstein's letter to FDR, which started it all, is not mentioned at all.The movie spends way too much time on the boring Strauss character. I guess it was because of who played him. The movie is just a hodgepodge of scenes jumping from times and places, slapped together without much thought to a story arc. It should have been a great thriller.",4,Oppenheimer
"Christopher Nolan tackles one of the most divisive scientific achievements in human history--the invention of the atomic bomb--through the lens of it's chief creator, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and the resulting fallout this achievement had on Oppenheimer himself.A devastating and unflinchingly clear movie, it weaves through time with two main points of view, filmed alternatively in beautifully rendered colour and in a starkly entrancing black and white. This movie must be seen in a movie theatre, it practically demands it, with sweeping shots and visual effects of the absolute highest calibre. There is no question that what you are seeing is practically reality, the complexity and beauty of the visuals giving the sense that you are seeing things exactly as Oppenheimer saw them. It is a stunning achievement of direction, to make a movie so in-tune with its main character that every single emotion can be felt through the screen, and much of that can be attributed to the capability of Cillian Murphy, the undoubted star of this movie, whose piercing eyes and extreme subtlety lend to him a quiet fragility amongst total and utter conviction, unpicking a man of contradictions in a manner which reveals the depth of feeling and conflict that Oppenheimer battled throughout his life. He is not an easy character to like, and that is the point. He is a flawed genius, as they all are, a man with ego, with compassion, with the mental strength to coordinate a titanic effort to change the world, and whose emotions can be overwhelmed in a single phone call.A triumph of perspective, it is a character study which leaps through time and space in a way which would unbalance most biopics. Under Nolan's careful hand, every sequence informs another, slowly unfurling, slowly building tension which reaches not one, not two, but three spectacular peaks of release.Between these peaks, however, are the troughs, necessary exposition and quieter moments given to the movie, where it almost feels like the train is running to a stop, only for it to pick up and roar you straight into the heart of the next great scene. These troughs are where the movie wallows a little too much osce-wise, where it gets lost in the details and becomes a little muddled.Its other great failure is the scarcity of character given in particular to Kitty, Oppenheimer's wife, and his two children. Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh give more dimension to characters who, through no fault of their own, are forced onto the sidelines through the sheer scope of Nolan's narrative, but whose involvement is still vital to the emotional core of the movie. Robert Downey Jr takes the other big role of Lewis Strauss, a government official who recruits Oppenheimer to a government board on Atomic Energy after the war. He gives Strauss the necessary charisma, the necessary intensity to push back against Murphy's total control of the screen.Ludwig Goransson's score is exceptional, motifs appearing perfectly in sync with a superb sound design, lending so much extra intensity and detail to so many sequences in this movie. The sound design is simply perfection, adding to the narrative and to the character of Oppenheimer as well. Jennifer Lame's editing is so so brilliant, especially in the sequences where tension is high. Clean, efficient, technically masterful editing which turns scenes into with hammer blows.Lastly, Tom Conti's brief appearances as the famed physicist Albert Einstein provide the perfect pivot moments of the movie, putting down a definitive stamp of almost prophetic authority on a fittingly complex, nuanced, and chillingly beautiful portrait of the man who helped change the reality of the world as we know it.",9,Oppenheimer
"The only thing that kept me from giving this film a 9 instead of an 8 is the length. Not much shorter than the actual war. The directing was excellant and the cast is superb. The only one I had a small problem with was the choice for President Truman. I think in real life Truman was gruffer. Other than that, everyone was right on. I believe the story line was fairly accurate as was the locations. I strongly recommend seeing this film, if you can sit for 3 hours. So, pack a lunch, put your feet up and enjoy. I think you will not feel cheated and certainly not happy and upbeat but very informed.",8,Oppenheimer
"The true story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the renowned physicist who during World War II was appointed by Gen. Leslie Groves to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer spent years developing the atomic bomb, with his team of scientists. Their work led ultimately to success after they finally witness the first nuclear explosion in world history. However, when it is ultimately used against the Japanese, which brings about the end of the war. Oppenheimer is forced to face the current and future moral implications that would lead to the arms race.It's safe to say that the anticipation surrounding Oppenheimer has been palabale. The historical biopic by Christopher Nolan. The groundbreaking writer, director, and producer who reinvented the Batman comic book mythology with his Dark Knight trilogy. Not forgetting a further back catalog of ambitious work which has included Memento, Inception, Interstellar, and more aptly Dunkirk. Apt in that it shares the same period of World History as this his latest offering. Both a character study, as well as a depiction of the events leading to what would, and continues to be one of the most morally divisive and contentious moments in World History. The dropping of the atomic bomb on the Japanese cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Moments that in due course, led to the surrender of Japan. A hotly debated issue seeing as Germany had already surrendered, and it was believed by some that the Japanese would soon follow. Although with the war against the Japanese still being fought, American casualties were continuing to rise.Seemingly, Nolan makes no secret where his opinion lies on the subject. Taking opposition with then president, Harry H. Truman who finally gave the go-ahead. To this end, and using Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwitnthe's biography American Prometheus, as the film's template. The director sets about getting into the mind of Oppenheimer while chronicling, his work, and the political fallout of the man expressing his political views in the wake of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. To this end, the film juggles several time frames, one being the early academic life of the young future physicist, and his recruitment by Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) to head the Manhattan Project, which would lead to the Trinity Test. The 1954 Atomic Energy Committee Security Personnel hearings where Oppenheimer was accused of disloyalty, and having communist sympathies. And finally, the Senate hearings which were carried out to confirm the testimony of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) and the opposition from other scientists who thought Oppenheimer had been treated poorly.Initially, an anxious, conscious young man in his early years of academia. The future physicist would eventually develop into a more confident, charismatic, and charming figure. In this respect, Cillian Murphy proves to be an inspired casting choice who adroitly conveys the integrity and conviction of him. Seamlessly bridging the transition from his more youthful personae. Although one might have perceived him to be slightly lofty in nature, it's here as well that we see his shortcomings which are authentically realized. For all of his intelligence, one might have accused him of being naive. In so much as his communist associations in his own social circles. Something that comes back to dog him later in his professional life. He is indeed portrayed as a complex man and one who allowed himself to enter into an undertaking that would lead to ramifications of equitable complexity. His beliefs shifted into what was paradoxical in nature, which were exploited by those who politically opposed him. And Nolan's depiction of this is executed with sharp dramatic precision in his first hearings. Oppenheimer's personal life wasn't a bed of roses either, having a dalliance with his former lover, Jean Tatlock (Florance Pugh) whilst being married to his long-suffering wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt) and the dirty linen of which was made openly known. Ostensibly though she remained with her husband, even when he would bare the mantle of a martyr when being interrogated. Attempting to retain some shred of composed dignity much to her frustration and anguish. Hero or villain, whatever you make of him he at least was not one stay silent. Murphy flawlessly portrays a man who was never one to cower in fear of the inevitable backlash. Even in the face of the potential price it might have cost him domestically.Nolan is not one as well to shy away from adding some stylistic touches, which are complemented by Hoyte Van Hoytema's striking cinematography. Most notably as the Manhattan Project began to come to a close, and the testing of the H-bomb was fully tested. A moment captured mostly in a deafening, ethereal silence and visual splendor that contradicts the explosive devastation and fury of what has been unleashed. Finally climaxing with an ominous, thunderous explosion of sound. It's practically deiform, in its ferocity.Supported by a consummate ensemble cast that includes, Matthew Modine, Rami Malek Josh Hartnett, and Kenneth Branagh all giving stirring back-up. It's Robert Downey Jr. Who stands among the crowd, delivering what should be deserving of Oscar recognition. Oppenheimer is the story of a man, consumed with ideological persuasions, that are also countered by reservations, about how they should be implemented and punished for them by those who became ethically opposed to him. If there is a niggle it is that at times due to Nolan's use of sound mix feels mooted and echoey, making dialogue difficult to discern. Otherwise, Oppenheimer makes for a superb three hour watch, which while asking for your attention so that you may fully appreciate and understand the historical relevance. It's an ask that will pay off with great dividends.",9,Oppenheimer
"10/10. Gripping, suspenseful and surprisingly intimate. Great casting, even better performances, superb dialogue, and fantastic story telling. Cilian Murphy, Robert Downey, and even Gary Oldman (as short as his time was in the film) deserve Oscar nominations at the very least. Emily blunt was also amazing. This is Nolan's best work and it's not even close. Every scene had meaning, no useless scenes or useless dialogue. A lot of people seem to forget it's not just about the Manhattan project, it's about OPPENHEIMER.Most of the bad reviews are from people who think the dark knight trilogy is Nolan's best work.",10,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer.The story of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer and his role in the development of the atomic bomb.Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a biography about one of the most important characters in the modern history J. Robert Oppenheimer, it's more like a situation study and not a character study we see Oppenheimer's through what he does and what does happen to him with a little bit of his psychological life either.The character was a very complicated one, what can be more complicated than being a scientist in a war era and when your country is relying on you to make a weapon, to win a war.This matter got me thinking the whole movie, the morality of it and how Oppenheimer can be seen today, as a national hero for the Americans and one of the greatest scientist ever or just a selfish person, a careless one.The plot was very interesting obviously and I was fully focused on everything but somehow there were so many characters and scientists that I couldn't follow up, besides the 3 hours was filled with dialogs more than anything else and I can say they were some of the best I've ever seen, one of Nolan's best undoubtedly.Talking about the man himself, Nolan did some great achievement here in filmmaking, he's been competing himself until he brought us a CGI free movie about a nuclear bomb, you imagine!The practical visual effects were magnificent, especially the transitions at the first hour of the movie, I loved what they did there.Besides, one of the most thrilling build-ups is when they were launching a bomb to test it for the first time, it was perfect with the unexpected silent/loud thing and everything, however the scale of the explosion was disappointing a bit.Finally, I should mention that Cillian Murphy did the performance of his career, a one to remember far away from everything he ever did, Cillian as Oppenheimer was very powerful and he needs a reward as much as Robert Downey jr deserves it too, this duo carried the movie without a doubt .I can't forget Emily Blunt that deserves a nomination at least, I'd love that and everyone else from Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh to Rami Malek with his unbelievable scene, the cast was truly iconic .A very rewarding 3 hours, can't wait to see it again .Oups, I forgot to mention the soundtracks! Absolutely beautiful .",9,Oppenheimer
"Thinking person's Cold War film, really. Dialogue heavy, so you have to pay attention or you may miss something. The non-linear narrative may not work for everyone, but we all know this is how Nolan makes his films. Therefore, we need to be ready for it. The acting was top notch, although Emily Blunt deserved more screen time. Same for Florence Pugh, really. So, there's a lot of mansplaining in this film, so to speak. Maybe that's a reflection of the subject matter's eras, but in a modern world, it is very noticeable. It doesn't detract from the quality of the film, but perhaps it makes us think that the film could have been a lot better if done differently. Either way, highly recommend this film for informative, intellectual, and thought-provoking ideas about humanity and science. Probably a lot of lessons in here about AI, too, using the idea expressed in Jurassic Park: The scientists were so concerned with whether they could, they didn't think about whether they should.",10,Oppenheimer
"Traces the story of Robert Oppenheimer from so-so college student through to his fascination with quantum mechanics and the setting up of The Manhattan Project and the development of the atomic bomb. This is all against a womanising background, his somewhat dangerous dabblings with politics and the American government's obsession with communism and the determination to pin that on Oppenheimer and relieve him of all authority after the war.Fascinating how Christopher Nolan, who clearly knows his stuff, has written and directed such an extremely detailed analysis of Oppenheimer and his flawed character and never once treats us as anything less than reasonably intelligent - quite a novelty. You are never bored going through the man's history because Nolan's script is so sharp, the whole thing is gorgeous to look it, the soundtrack impressive but mostly because the actors - Murphy, Downey Jr, Blunt, Damon and briefly Pugh are just flat out fabulous in their roles - surely must feature in next year's Oscar's. This is not light storytelling, you do have to concentrate to benefit, but ultimately it is a very impressive piece of mainstream cinema, sadly, rarely seen much these days.",8,Oppenheimer
"Even though I'm not all that attached to the story, the way the film portrays the complex emotions of the ""Father of the Atomic Bomb"" is fascinating. It gives audiences like us the freedom to interpret the identity of Oppy through the perspectives of him and the people around his life. Even though the film is mainly told from the Destroyer of Worlds's point of view, one can't help but think accordingly: in fact, What kind of person does he see himself as?This is the most different Nolan's flavor. Heavy politics, lots of dialogue, and a little bit of time-shifting narrative. It's a pity that I didn't have a chance to watch it in IMAX. Apart from the visuals, the sound in the normal theater is also not satisfying enough for me.I'm not that much into it, but still, this is one of the finest films of the year.",8,Oppenheimer
"The movie takes a reasonably interesting look at Oppenheimers life and work. It uses the most part of its 3 hours runtime focusing around two periods of Oppenheimers life: the time in Los Alamos and the time around the hearing for the renewal of his security clearance. The latter one is the anchor from which the movie jumps around the other timeframes.While the movie gives an ok view of Oppenheimer on the outside, it never gets into his head. Instead, it keeps his thoughts and motives a mystery. This is done by design, it's not an oversight. For me, this is the film's greatest flaw. The events and people around Oppenheimer are known and can be read and watched from many sources. His inner workings are never part of that, so an examination, even if it was a kind of best approximation, would be something new.However, it is not the films only flaw. It feels jumpy in it's movement between the timelines, and the methods to keep them apart for the viewer seem somewhat crude. Then there is the director's play with sound volume that really got on my nerves. Nolan started this around Interstellar and Dunkirk and adopted it as a signature style element of his. For me, it's an attack on the ears and way too loud in a good theater.Then there is the smaller stuff. Oppenheimer's surroundings and times were filled with great minds, some of which appear for longer or shorter screentime. Sadly, all of the stay cardboard cutouts with no depth at all. The deserved more.So yeah, the movie's a bit meh. It's not a bad movie, all considered, but it's also far from good. And maybe a movie is not the right format for the subject. There was just too much going on in that time and too many people of importance involved in the events. I think a limited series, maybe 6 parts of an hour or so would have been a better idea.Watch it anyway. It's too important not to.",6,Oppenheimer
"So in the electronic / synth music world, its a sin to criticise anything the Mode do.I definitely feel the same can be said about Nolans films. He has made some great films, The Prestige, Interstellar & Memento. But on the other hand, has has made some stinkers, Tennent was appallingly stupid.This looks absolutely beautiful, the cinematography is sensational. The performances are very good, Murphy plays the lead perfectly and Emily Blunt plays a brilliant drunk. However there are some terrible accents, is Kenneth Branagh meant to be South African?Problem with this movie is, it's very confusing, its also very, very boring, it doesn't pack any kind of emotion, we are talking about the most shameful moment in history, yet, somehow it clearly manages to avoid any of that.Very boring.",5,Oppenheimer
"The film is interesting from a political point of view, showing the influences of power. However, too much time is spent on that, and not enough on what would make sense to an audience unfamiliar with the story. As a result, many elements are skipped over. First, it lacks empathy for its main character, who seems lost in the middle of a cause that is beyond him, even though he has succeeded in carrying out a project of considerable scope, and, above all, ignores the consequences of the invention, both for the inhabitants of the research site and in Japan, and Oppenheimer's stance on arms control. A great pity.",10,Oppenheimer
"The whole movie I was wondering how it couldn't possibly have any CGI in it.Seeing the Trinity test in theaters was the best choice, it's too beautiful, surprising and with a lot of tension. It made me think how terrifying a third world war with those kinds of weapons would be.I loved Cilian Murphy's performance, I could feel the problems happening in his mind, but making clear Nolan's excellent direction.There were many dialogue scenes, but then they put many more dialogue scenes with an exquisite soundtrack and performances that caused my eyes to open even more.Unbelievably I was left wanting more, I want to see more!!!!",9,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer is a wonderful, immaculate film-a beautifully crafted, powerful story chronicling the human impact of its historical events. It's full of character and tension.The only thing keeping it from a 10/10 is that Josh Peck, our beloved god-king, only had 4 lines of dialogue in the film.If they had given him a larger role, expanded his character's backstory, perhaps given him a sex scene, and allowed our master to showcase his unmatched talent and glory, then perhaps Nolan's latest film could have reached its coveted masterpiece status.But, as it stands, it's a pretty great film with not enough Josh Peck.",9,Oppenheimer
I will definitely going to watch it again on IMAX when I get the chance as this is some high quality story telling. The movie is worth the hype created before the release.Cillian Murphy did an exceptional job and no one will gonna surprise if he gets the Oscar for it.Robert Downey also steals the show whenever he got a chance to do his job. Emily and Florence did their part however small it was but impact will remain.The music shines in this movie in every frame. You will definitely feel the music going through your veins with the scene and that's brilliance of Nolan and his team. This is a ðŸ’Ž gem.,10,Oppenheimer
"It's crazy how one of the most anticipated summer blockbuster films of this year is based on a historic figure...and it's directed by Christopher Nolan. I think this is the movie people been wanting for a while. Something not action-pack, not computer generated, not fun or silly quips, but something new or refreshing that us audiences haven't seen in a long time. Even with Nolan's style of filmmaking, this movie feels different from the rest of his work. It's basically a 3-hour movie about J. Robert Oppenheimer rises and fall of his fame as becoming the ""father of the atomic bomb."" It's mostly people talking throughout the movie, but the main focus is Oppenheimer which is more of a character study in his point of view and Lewis Strauss. The cast was fantastic, it was visually stunning, the music score is very tense like you were a part of that certain scene, the story was great as usual from Christoper Nolan. Sometimes the sound mixing can be loud between dialogues, but I can easily make it out what characters are saying. In the end, the movie will leave you in fear for what the future of a nuclear weapons will be and the consequences.",10,Oppenheimer
"There's always 3 sides to a story. In this case it will be, Oppenheimer's, then there is Christopher Nolan's version (based on the biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin) and the truth. We hope and pray that what's shown is as close to the real story; magnified for cinema, but true to the events that happened.Having said that, this is a brilliantly-made film and Christopher Nolan gets better and better with every new movie. Unlike the usual conventional biopics, he creates a wonderful layered examination of a man via all his great accomplishments and fundamental flaws.Through a judicial committee interrogation, Oppenheimer is haunted by errors of his judgement, shown through flashbacks of pivotal moments in his life. We get a perspective of what his mind would've been processing through this harrowing period of his life where all his hard work could get mitigated by powerful government officials. Nolan manages to work his magic in the best possible way, striking a balance between showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.The film presents Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for. He can be viewed as a martyr and a scapegoat simultaneously, for the manner in which he managed to end the deadliest conflict in world history, while ushering in something even worse.A career best performance from the consistently brilliant Cilian Murphy. He gives his all to the role of Robert J. Oppenheimer. And Robert Downey Jr shows that he hasn't forgotten acting post his 10 years' stint as Iron Man. This is one of his best roles. The rest of the cast, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Rami Malek, add significantly to the film's talent pool.Having expressed his dislike about the use of Computer Generated Imagery, Nolan keeps viewers on their toes through good directorial proficiency. The creative use of editing keeps the story moving at a brisk pace, especially considering the movie's 3 hour run-time. The cinematography and soundtrack (mostly soundscapes) further create an unmatched cinematic experience.",10,Oppenheimer
"This movie is like solid 8 but really not easy to understand. There are several layers like politics, moral, family, history, science and if you want to get the full experience you might need to be like 60-70 years old professor from US who has vivid interest in politics and is really open-minded. Seriously, I was prepared although not falling into this category but most of the audience I think did not understand a lot as they were too young and politically fragile. And that is not even touching the morals of the story or ancient history mentioned briefly. Or consequences for the Japanese that were so terrible. Go there, watch and come back to this movie in 10-15 years again if you are under 45.",8,Oppenheimer
"I was very slightly cautious about this movie after Dunkirk disappointed, but Nolan once again proves that film an outlier in his quest to deliver masterpiece after masterpiece of cinema.""Oppenheimer"" does not disappoint the viewer at all. Cillian Murphy delivers his finest onscreen performance of his career, one that should undoubtedly draw multiple nominations and awards of the highest order. The same could be said of the entire tremendously put together ensemble cast.Forget the awards however, if they come they come. With or without them this film stands on its own as arguably the greatest film of the 2020's so far, and it very well might maintain that status.I didn't even see the film in IMAX (due to the horrible availability of the format) and the visual and sound were incredible, and I could feel the force it provided throughout the film in my seat as Nolan intended even in a regular cinema.",10,Oppenheimer
I'm a huge Nolan fan and went into the cinema expecting yet another 9/10 experience. I was disappointed.In my opinion the form doesn't fit the story. It's too infomation-dense to be a movie. It should've been a 5-episode mini series like Chernobyl or a semi-documentury feature on Discovery Channel. I found myself overwhelmed by all the dialogue and the constant switching of time lines.I also thought it was too pretentious. Almost every scene feels like a build up towards something important. The music is constantly rushing you like you have to prepare for something to happen. But nothing happens. Even the moment where the bomb is tested for the first time is an anti-climax.The acting is supercious and there are no oscar worthy performances. Cillian Murphy doesn't have the skills to portray a vast array of emotions. He only has two or three expressions.I give it a 7 for the production quality and the effort that has been put into it. But a 7 is too high for the experience I had.Don't go to the cinema. Wait for it to come out on a streaming service so you can pause to catch a breath and watch it like a mini-series. The form the story was supposed to have.,7,Oppenheimer
"Well firstly not a typical Nolan film. More of a biopic drama documentary that definitely does not need to be seen on Imax. It also does not need to be 3 hours long, wow it really drags.I get the subject matter is profound but the direction and delivery of this movie was so convoluted and dry that I feel they had to throw in the porn scenes just for some added excitement. Anyone who says they needed those scenes to make it realistic should also believe they needed to see Oppenheimer defecating too as that is also something people do.What also was confusing was how irrelevant Einstein's role in this movie was that he almost didn't need to be there?Also the whole movie they are talking about the hydrogen bomb and the potential of it causing a chain reaction but ultimately made an atomic bomb?The fact there are way too many characters in this movie make it even more hard to follow and the whole Strauss fiasco at the end was very predictable.I would say save your money and watch this on your TV. Definitely not IMAX or 70mm worthy.",4,Oppenheimer
"What an fantastic movie. It was the most anticipated movie (after Christopher Nolan announcement) and Nolan has delivered the gem. His direction, camera shots and sound was perfect at each and every moment. Watched it 1st day 1st show. Top notch acting by everyone and you will get to know the story of what Sir Julius Robert Oppenheimer had gone throughout the years (right from the recruitment for the project). Though he believed in himself and his intuitions that he will win not today but someday. After so many years of dedication towards the cinema Cillian Murphy has given fantabulous performance and right judge for the role.",9,Oppenheimer
"We always believe Nolan's films are always confusing and mind boggling but the recent Oppenheimer is Nolan's one of the best work.Atomic Bombing & The Dialogues are the main theme for me..The buildup in the first half clearly wins the shows in second.Cilian Murphy is exceptional as always but Robert Downey Jr clearly gave his career best.Marvellous casting just added flavours to this dish. The Dialogue Exchange throughout the film is the most Standout Part!!!Robert J Oppenheimer is still a Mystery for the people!This is what Cinema is all about &
Christopher Nolan is Master of it.Period!",9,Oppenheimer
"Theory. Plutonium. Fire. Noise. Death. Morality. Compartmentalization. Oppenheimer.I'm halfway through my Barbenheimer journey, and it's my first in-theater Christopher Nolan experience! I liked what I saw a lot, I love a good borderline psychological horror deep dive into a tortured soul. A film like Spencer comes to mind after watching something like this.The moral conundrum between a scientific genius and the destruction he orchestrated is shown clearly in sequences before, during and after the bomb drops in Japan. The casting was perfect, the film is nothing short of a showcase in acting. It would've been nice to see more of Josh Peck and Devon Bostick, but everyone gives it their all here, especially Cillian Murphy & RDJ.The runtime might be intimidating for some, but it's worth it because in my opinion, not a second is wasted. And that test bomb drop might be one of the most insane things ever made for a film. My jaw legitimately dropped wide open and I couldn't believe how lucky I was to be experiencing this moment in the theater..

"His deep blue eyes lay buried in those sockets as he watched the clouds of death and destruction from a distance. His lips quivered but his face showed no emotion. It's like he's frozen in time. Reading this & then imagining how Cillian portrayed it, you'll realise that you've experienced some rare acting skills.Oppenheimer (played by Cillian), whose life (like the black-and-white to colour-changing frames) has multiple shades. His mind conjures up permutations and combinations of endless possibilities in the field of physics and Nolan perfectly shows those mere monologues in his mind.Performances make the film more of a human experience than watching characters from a history textbook. Robert Downey Jr delivers his career-best performance as Lewis Strauss, Cillian Murphy shakes you to the core as Oppenheimer, Emily blunt has nailed in all the scenes she has appeared in and small but impactful acting of Matt Damon is on point. There are other actors worth mentioning & they done their best too.There's nothing I can write about Direction cause it's done by Nolan. I can only say one thing that Our generation is truly lucky to witness Nolan in his prime. He is one of the last-standing filmmakers of our era who is so true to the craft and magic that films can create. Oppenheimer is not only Nolan's best work to date, but in the world of fast-food cinema, it is an exquisite offering from a top-class chef.Lastly imo ""Oppenheimer"" is easily the best film of 2023.",10,Oppenheimer
"My mind was immediately blanked after the three-hour movie was done, but it wasn't confusion or any negative feelings that overwhelmed me. It was the ending scene that hit me hard, a simple yet profound conversation between two scientific greats, Albert Einstein and J. Robert Oppenheimer. Hours after the movie's conclusion, scenes flashed in my mind, and I tried to piece them together, yet I found myself grappling with an unanswered question: ""What exactly do I feel?"" The movie had left me with an indescribable sense of wonder. The following day, my thoughts remained fixated on the movie, prompting me to focus on myself instead of researching it further. In this introspection, I realized that ""Oppenheimer"" stands apart from any other movie I have experienced. It isn't driven by piquant conversations about morality or philosophy like ""12 Angry Men"" or ""Network."" Instead, it allows you to immerse yourself in the sentiments of a REAL HUMAN, whose mind is brimming with complications and contradictions. The movie's ending scene, which at first seemed simple, had become a profound catalyst for my reflections on the world.""Oppenheimer"" is an amazing cinematic experience, showcasing the brilliance of cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema. Through captivating visuals, the film skillfully conveys the full range of human emotions. Christopher Nolan's exceptional direction takes us on a remarkable journey, deftly delivering the story with finesse.The performances of all the actors, no matter how small their roles, are nothing short of exceptional. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer authentically captures the scientist's intellectual brilliance and inner conflicts. Emily Blunt, in her role as Kitty Oppenheimer, brings depth to her character, portraying a strong and supportive partner during the turbulent scientific pursuit.Particularly praiseworthy is Matt Damon's role as Leslie Groves, the general overseeing the Manhattan Project. Damon's performance exudes conviction and gravitas, adding a remarkable dimension to the movie.And now, a special mention for Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss in the movie. Renowned for his iconic portrayal of Tony Stark in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Downey Jr. Surprises with an exceptional performance as Strauss. He portrays a complex character with depth and conviction, showcasing his incredible talent as an actor.""Oppenheimer"" leaves a profound impact, transcending a simple historical retelling. The film delves into the intricacies of a brilliant scientist's mind, exploring the complexities and contradictions that often accompany intellectual greatness. It compels us to confront the moral dilemmas faced by those who contribute to groundbreaking scientific discoveries and the far-reaching consequences of their actions.The ending scene, featuring the poignant conversation between J. Robert Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein, resonates deeply, leaving us with a lingering contemplation of their choices and the immense responsibility that comes with knowledge.To truly appreciate ""Oppenheimer,"" avoid getting lost in the minutiae of the details. Instead, surrender yourself to its beautiful cinematography and allow the emotions the director intended to wash over you. The film presents a thought-provoking portrayal of the complexities of a human mind. As you watch, absorb the sentiment and contemplate the impact of a simple conversation between two brilliant scientists on the world's fate.""Oppenheimer"" is more than just a movie; it's a captivating experience that stays with you long after the credits roll. Christopher Nolan's visionary direction, coupled with the exceptional performances of the cast, makes ""Oppenheimer"" a must-watch film that transcends the boundaries of traditional cinema. This movie is a testament to the power of storytelling and its ability to challenge our perceptions, evoke genuine emotions, and provoke meaningful reflections on the course of human history.Additionally, I urge the audience not to overanalyze every detail, for doing so may overwhelm the senses. Instead, sit back, enjoy the beautiful cinematic journey, and immerse yourself in the emotions that the director has skillfully crafted. ""Oppenheimer"" offers a unique exploration of the human spirit and leaves us with an unanswerable question-a question that perhaps has no definitive answer. Yet, therein lies the beauty of this cinematic masterpiece.",9,Oppenheimer
"Saw this tonight at a premier party in Oak Ridge, TN of all places. Packed house. Sold out in all theatres. Gotta admit I wish I had gone to imax just for a few scenes, but really, most of the movie was really about political drama as opposed to the atomic bomb. I was really impressed with the acting and think Cillian Murphy deserves an Oscar. Nolan-maybe. Downey, probably no. I liked him and he did a great job, don't get me wrong, but I'll admit, until I realized the motivations of his character I didn't really understand his significance. Movie could have done a better job at pointing out what the political points were in the second half because I was little lost. I did think that the final third of the movie dragged a little but maybe that's because I was in about my 5th hour at the theatre, with the premier pre activities, and was pretty tired. I will say that, for me, the payoff was, after all the congressional hearings and back room interrogation, the last two minutes. It brought it all together for me. So, while I did love this movie, I can't quite give it past an 8 for some of the aspects that didn't just quite make it the experience I thought it was going to be.",8,Oppenheimer
"Powerful. Sublime. All this adjectives used for this movie are absolutely right. The double plot in this movie works really well, and the cuts between scenes showed us perfectly what time it really was. The cinematography resonates with the weightiness of the subject, weaving a visual tapestry of awe. And, of course, let us not forget the exceptional brilliance of every actor and actress, each breathing life into their characters with sheer marvel. A masterpiece and a future classic for sure.Synopsis:
During World War II, Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr. Appoints physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer and a team of scientists spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. Their work comes to fruition on July 16, 1945, as they witness the world's first nuclear explosion, forever changing the course of history.",9,Oppenheimer
"I saw this film in the context of the upcoming UAP/UFO disclosure, which is tightly linked to nuclear proliferation. UAP's have taken an interest in nuclear test sites since their inception, including documented cases of them 'turning off' multiple missile and missile silo's, and I think that this is possible what is being referred to as the chain reaction to change the world.I also watched this movie in terms of AI, we can't stop weaponizing it because otherwise someone else will weaponize it, in turn creating another Cold War in which mutual planetary destruction will help keep nations in check.There really are 2 movies here, the one you watch, and the one that underpins the psychopathic nature of our pathological existence on this planet. This is home, there is no planet B, we really need to stop f-ing it up.The way I look at it, we're monkey's with a big red button that says, 'maybe don't push', but look where that's gotten us.Thank Nolan for making us think and making us truly understand the gruesome nature of the military industrial complex, the machine that's still churning and has now found a place to expend It's soon to expire ammunition in the Ukraine conflict, that's practical.When we're no longer here, it's okay because this space rock will keep on turning, even when the human race is burning.",10,Oppenheimer
"Well, Oppy is quite an experience. In many ways it's an amazing film, BUT... it's stubbornly nonlinear, as if someone shuffled the storyboards. And somewhat impressionistic. I think Nolan was trying to capture in visuals both the psychological noise of that super-secret project and the zeitgeist of that pressure-packed era - without abandoning the narrative. At 3 hours in length, it's probably not everyone's cup of tea - I realized halfway through I wished we had gone to a theatre with reclining chairs. It really helps if you know the arc of Oppenheimer's story, or at least the moral ambiguity that tempered the scientific deadline to develop a device that ""could"" end life on earth.Caveat: if you're taking your dad, and he just got a pacemaker, bring ear plugs for him. Nolan and his sound designer play audio pranks throughout the film, following a quiet or silent passage with sudden deafening sound.",7,Oppenheimer
"I for one can not understand how christopher nolan fools studio executives into giving him money to produce so many terrible films. If they would only give more money to the sound crew, they might not turn the bass subwoofer & one note drone volumes up to 11 & the dialogue down to 2, so that no one has a clue of what is being said or going on.Every screening of this over long, 3 hour bass boosted dross should have sub-titled. You'd think lessons would've been learned from tenet & his previous movies but obviously not.I wish someone else would've made a coherent telling of such an important man & his story.2/10.",2,Oppenheimer
"Be aware, I'm not tagging this review with spoilers, but I will discuss some of the real life history. If you believe that would count as a spoiler stop reading now.Okay, with that out of the way...Oppenheimer is a dense, talkie, mature, multilayered character study that does a lot right. This is probably Nolan's most mature film when it comes to politics and historical complexity, as it deals with the paradoxical realities of the era its set in and offers a truly three dimensional portrait of its main characters and especially Oppenheimer himself. There are some incredible performances here, including career best work from Cillian Murphy as the lead. The music score is fantastic, although it sometimes drowns out the dialogue, and the film is beautifully shot. I know some reviews have said this is an ""ugly"" film but I completely disagree. There are some truly awe-inspiring shots here and everything fits the story and the tone well. I saw this in regular 70mm and will see it again in IMAX 70mm in a few days. Some of the best shots are deceptively simple ones.In fact, I'd say the first 2/3rds of this movie are a genuine masterpiece. The pacing is exceptional. The editing reminded me a bit of some of Oliver Stone's 90s movies (like JFK or Natural Born Killers) or Scorsese's faster paced films, and it really helps to get you into the head of Oppenheimer himself. There are some shots where dialogue isn't properly synced, but I think this fit the headspace of the main character. In other words, Nolan was purposely breaking the rules. There's one scene that blatantly breaks the 180 rule and it's incredibly effective at disorienting the audience in the same way Oppenheimer himself is disoriented.So yes, I'd say this a 9/10 or even 10/10 movie right up to the actual Trinity test. And then the film kinda falls apart. Most importantly, the test itself is hugely underwhelming. This is a case where Nolan's insistence on doing everything practically is actually a net negative. The explosion never looks like an actual atom bomb. It's clearly just a big explosion they did for real in the desert, and while there is some wonderful sound design in this scene, it never captures the awe and terror that we need to feel. A little bit of CGI enhancement could have gone a long way. Even in the old days things weren't just done for real; you'd sometimes use composite effects or miniatures to create a desired effect bigger than anything you could capture entirely in camera.Regardless of what you think of the show, Twin Peaks had an episode that depicts the Trinity test in one long unbroken shot, and that single shot is far more effective than anything we see here at actually depicting the almost mystical terror of the atom bomb. If you took that scene and cut it into this movie, with snap cuts to the reaction shots, you'd have a much more powerful sequence. The film spends a long time building up to this and it's so underwhelming that it's hard to not be disappointed. I could tell the energy of the packed audience also changed after this scene, and people started to get a little antsy in their seats.Speaking of which: most of the last act is meandering, overly talkie, and stagnant. I don't know why the film decided to focus so much on a character other than Oppenheimer; that may have worked well in a miniseries, but for a feature all of that could have been condensed into a third of the time and instead we could have spent more time with Oppenheimer coming to terms with his feelings about what he did and his role in world history. This is when the breakneck cutting finally needed to slow down and let us breathe a bit, but if anything, it just speeds up, like it's trying to get through a billion things at once. The last act of the film kinda feels like homework.With that said, the very last five minutes are incredible, and gave me chills. It's probably my favorite ending sequence from any Nolan film.This is an ambitious and complex work, and it's worth seeing. It has some of Nolan's finest directing in it and you will be thinking about it after you leave the theater. But it can't quite stick the landing. Compare this to another biopic, Lawrence of Arabia (in my humble opinion probably the greatest biopic ever made). There's a great scene where a man yells out to Lawrence, ""WHO ARE YOU??"" and the shot lingers and holds on his face. It's an incredible moment of filmmaking and acting at their best. In Oppenheimer, this scene would have been half the length and intercut with three other scenes at the same time. In other words, the last act this film desperately needed to slow down and focus more on the psychology of its characters and less on the politics. It also would have been great to see some additional scenes following the end of WW2, such as the demon core accident which happened in August of 1945.With all of that said, this is still a GOOD movie, and anyone remotely interested in history or filmmaking should see it. For me, Nolan's best films are still The Prestige, Memento and Inception, but this may win him an Oscar.",8,Oppenheimer
"""Oppenheimer"" is a stellar addition to Christopher Nolan's lineup. This movie showcases Nolan's gift for visuals with stunning cinematography that captures the intensity of its historical backdrop. The performances are top-notch, with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Delivering particularly standout performances, enriching the narrative with their depth and complexity.The film's pace is leisurely, giving audiences time to immerse in the story's vast scope. While some might find this slower rhythm slightly prolonged, it affords a detailed exploration of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life and times.As a long-standing fan of Nolan's work, I hold ""Interstellar"" as his finest creation. This is my personal opinion and does not take away from the brilliance of ""Oppenheimer"". It is a deeply engaging film, filled with memorable performances and spectacular visuals. ""Oppenheimer"" is a must-watch for any Nolan enthusiast and anyone who appreciates masterfully crafted biopics.",8,Oppenheimer
"After Oppenheimer atomized an implausible theory born out of his mania, guiltily thinking about the effect of such a cruel atomization makes me wonder how we are living in this era of politicizing science!. If we think about it a little deeper, such thoughts have the potential to drive us to suicide, like the Japanese soldiers who committed ""seppuku"" (meaning ""slitting of the stomach"", a form of Japanese ritual suicide in which samurai death restores honor to themselves and their families) at the end of World War II!.The truth is that Christopher Nolan's writing has seen a depth in this act!. One scene in particular is when someone told Oppenheimer, ""I'm not going to have a part in this project!"" After saying that, he asked, ""To turn science, which has been developed for centuries, into a weapon that takes lives without mercy?"" The verses affected me a lot!It is amazing that Nolan chose actors according to the characters and that such artists dedicated themselves to it!. But what to do, the sentiments of the people of our country are untouchable, so Indian film censorship has been removed in the best interests of the people!.",9,Oppenheimer
"I'm over the moon with this film. From the visuals to the dialogue and the score. It is simply a masterpiece. Robert Downey, Jr. And Cillian Murphy both Deserves an Academy award. Cillian holds this film on his shoulders in a way I have never seen before. For 3 hours I was transported back to WW2 and the beginning of the military industrial complex.If you are going to this movie for action or to see the bombing of Hiroshima, you will be disappointed. This movie is a think piece. The challenge is the audience to think on moral levels challenging each of us just because we can should we.I plan on seeing this tomorrow and the day after. I'm sure there were things I missed and can't wait to discover by watching again.Christopher Nolan has definitely outdone himself. If I were him I would be honestly scared of my next project because how can you top this masterpiece. If anyone can I believe he can I just can't wait for his next release.",10,Oppenheimer
"This movie was absolutely brilliant. The performance from Cillian Murphy was so genuine as J. Robert Oppenheimer. A perfect performance from him.Robert Downey Jr also had one of the top performances in the film as well. One of the greatest of his career. Give that man an Oscar! Matt Damon, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh and Emily blur also gave incredible performances too. The guy that played Albert Einstein looked exactly like the genius himself I was spooked but in a good way.The sound in this film was a little scary. It physically made me jump, it was sonical.Christopher Nolan's direction on this phenomenal masterpiece was Masterclass and is for me the one to win best director throughout awards season.This movie for me is everything not one bad thing to say. Perfectly written, directed, cast and the production design was on a whole other level. Bless this film one of the greatest films of all time. 10/10.",10,Oppenheimer
"I recently witnessed the cinematic marvel 'Oppenheimer,' a gripping character study of the father of the atomic bomb. The movie introduces numerous characters and presents a ton of historical information at breakneck speed, making it challenging to grasp everything in one go. What adds to the complexity is Nolan's fantasy of playing with time - he chooses to tell the story in different timelines, intercutting between them at a frenetic pace. Yet, the film never loses our attention, keeping us engrossed in its mesmerizing narrative.The Trinity test sequence was masterfully directed, leaving a profound impact. Following the Trinity testing, Oppenheimer's address to a gathering was terrifying, evoking a choking sense of tension. The subsequent intense interrogation scene surpassed anything I had seen before, with a phenomenal score and expert sound design that elevated the impact to unimaginable levels.The climactic conversation of Oppenheimer with Einstein, along with the premonition of what he has unleashed, while the camera lingers on his terrifying portrait, is utterly mesmerizing - what a way to end the film!Eager to delve into the actual events and read more about them, I'm certain it will deepen my appreciation for Nolan's genius and the masterpiece he has crafted. I can't wait to rewatch it with newfound insights and admire the brilliance of his work even more.",10,Oppenheimer
"I'm glad i saw another Nolan film in the theatre. The amazing soundtrack, beautiful cinematography, outstanding performances... it's a masterpiece that tells the story of a necessary evilonce again, Cillian reminds us that he's one of the goats. Matt Damon is exceptional; the fleeting appearances of Gary Oldman and Casey Affleck don't leave anyone indifferent, and RDJ... in those last twenty minutes he shows that this is the best acting he has ever done in his lifethe Trinity test is one of the best sequences i've ever seen in a movie. Nolan is truly one of the greatest filmmakers of the modern cinema.",10,Oppenheimer
"Let me start by saying that I enjoyed this movie.All in all, after 3 hours, I felt like my time had been spent well watching a well-crafted, visually and emotionally compelling biography about Robert Oppenheimer.It was good. If you like film, go see it in a theater (in IMAX if possible)However, it is a Christopher Nolan film.Meaning.... A lot of characters to keep track of, longer run time, lots and lots of dialogue, etc.This is not the kind of movie you would turn on in the background while dozing off scrolling on instagram.This movie, you have to stay attentive to the details, dialogue, and the story.BUT, because of this hyper-focused nature of the movie, you truly start to feel the story and emotions behind Oppenheimer, and begin to understand the complex nature of Nolan's story telling. I'd say it's worth the extra focus.Personally, I'd set this as slightly better than Tenet, but not to the lengths of Inception.Go see it :)",8,Oppenheimer
"For a three hour film, it still proved not enough time to cover any part of his life with enough time to explore. Music all the way through the film which at times made me struggle to hear what was being said. Also felt that some scenes would have played better without music. Due to what felt like a rush to complete so many strands of his life, I never felt connected or to understand the man. A great cast but a film I would not watch again. I was never bored but it just did not have any emotional impact which surprised me. I am not a fan of nolan's previous film Tenet either. Three hours felt more like a rush job and was, in my opinion, average.",7,Oppenheimer
"The acting was amazing, the cinematography was also amazing, but thats where the good ends and the bad starts. 3 hours are you kidding me? This story could have been done in an hour forty-five with credits. There was too much filler garbage i was immediately annoyed. Glorifying the smartest people creating the biggest bomb after the worlds best scientific discovery was sickening. I know that was true, but it made me sick. Showing how twisted and demented our government is was a great idea. There is literally too many things i want to say but don't know how to word them. I highly recommend everyone see something else and save a lot of time. Watch this at home after it hits netflix.",3,Oppenheimer
"The best drama ever witnessed, one of the best dramatic experience . Its Nolan's masterpiece, every scene written is a master piece every dialogue, every screenplay has been crafted soo good. Cilian murphy who has just nailed with his performances, he just lived the character of oppenheimer. Oppenheimer is gem in the field of physics and atomic matter. He is soft and introvert which has been portrayed so perfect by murphy, i hope he gets an oscar for his performance in Oppenheimer. All others robert downey, emily , matt and pugh all did their supporting roles to perfect. Especially the strauss role played by our former iron man robert downey jr was world class, hope he gets an oscar too. A special recognition to the music , its the pillar to the movie, soo pure and different and really makes as feel , an ultra realistic experience. Overall an osm drama experience, a complete nolan film with cuts in. Please do watch in theaters.",8,Oppenheimer
"Just seen this movie today and i was completely lost in the world of this movie, 3 hrs passed just like the blink of eyes... This movie is a biography of J Robert Oppenheimer which tells us about how he became the father of atomic bomb and changed the world forever.. Cillian Murphy nailed the titular role without any doubt he is the finest actors of our generation you can see the emotions he shows on screen just by his face and that's how i can say that Christopher Nolan nailed the casting of this movie.. RDJ, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh all are perfectly cast in their roles of these real life persons who changed the course of our history.. RDJ is not just some comedic actor who played Iron Man in MCU but he is also one of the finest actors ever and you can feel this just by seeing his performance in this movie...Tom Conti also shines as legendry Albert Einstein in this movie even though his role of small... Christopher Nolan is able to deliver a masterpiece again in name of this movie which will be remembered for a very long time in future, without any doubt Oppenheimer will become a Classic in future since it's on of the greatest movies ever made...
Screenplay, Music, Cinematography, Pacing everything is just perfect.. If you know just even basic Science like Nuclear fission and fusion, division of atoms, electrons, hydrogen etc you'll love thus movie even more since you can easily understand what is shown on screen.. It just didn't acts as a political movie about World War, Communism but also as a basic human story about Morals, Humanity, God like power to mankind etc..The final scene where Oppenheimer regrets about giving ultimate destructive power to mankind will haunts you forever and that is the beauty of this movie.. We also see the personal lives of some prominent figures of history we go deeply into their thoughts and mind to exactly understand how history is changed by Manhatten project forever...Bottom line Oppenheimer is a peak level cinematic experience crafted masterfully by one of the greatest filmmaker of our generation which you can't miss at any cost.... Go and see it right now.",10,Oppenheimer
"A phenomenal watch. It may seem too long but once you are in, you forget everything and the focus is on Murphy. Nolan has given yet another masterpiece. Sound design was fabulous even though there were times when dialogues was overpowered by music.The movie takes you on a journey of Robert Oppenheimer and oh my, it was just amazing.The casting choices were nothing short of brilliant. Christian Bale's portrayal of Oppenheimer was nothing less than extraordinary. He captured the essence of the enigmatic scientist, showcasing his brilliance and inner conflict with remarkable depth and nuance. The supporting cast, including talented actors like Emily Blunt, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Cillian Murphy, delivered performances that were equally captivating and added layers of complexity to the narrative.",10,Oppenheimer
"The direction, as expected from Nolan, is nothing short of breathtaking. The way he weaves together past and present, merging personal struggles with scientific achievements, is nothing less than genius. The visuals are stunning, and the attention to detail in recreating the era is impeccable.And then there's Cillian Murphy, whose performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer is a tour de force. Murphy's dedication to the role is evident in every scene. He immerses himself in the character, bringing Oppenheimer's inner turmoil and brilliance to life with such nuance and authenticity that it's simply mesmerizing to watch.The emotional depth Murphy infuses into Oppenheimer's journey is astounding. From his struggles with the moral implications of his work to the personal sacrifices he makes, every aspect of the character is portrayed with precision and grace. Murphy's performance truly elevates the film to another level.If there's one thing I'm certain about after watching ""Oppenheimer,"" it's that Cillian Murphy deserves an Oscar for his outstanding portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer. His performance alone makes this film an unforgettable cinematic experience.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic marvel that leaves a profound impact on the viewer. Christopher Nolan's visionary direction combined with Cillian Murphy's Oscar-worthy performance makes this film an absolute must-watch. It's a masterpiece that will linger in your mind long after the credits roll.",10,Oppenheimer
"Such a good movie, but if you're clearly not interested at all in history, Oppenheimer, the Manhattan project, then obviously this will be boring for you. I do not know what people expected, all these negative reviews feel like little kids upset the teacher showed them a documentary in school or something.I was originally going to give this 9/10 because they definitely did hype up the explosion, saying they made it with practical effects but honestly it's the one thing that may have just been better with CGI. They definitely missed the mark on that, but then I realized it doesn't matter.This is essentially a drama, focusing on Oppenheimer's life and it was really interesting to see how it all actually happened, all the ""boring"" stuff they never usually talk about get captured really well.For example, I never knew much about Los Alamos, the extent to which Oppenheimer was or wasn't involved, and never really had a great picture on where this really fit in scientific history until after this movie.It's of course very thought provoking. It's not the type of movie to be watched twice, in my opinion, but very interesting as long as you're (again) interested in the actual subject of the movie. It's not going to bring in any strange plot twists like aliens invading the Earth, and it won't be action packed. I'm still glad I saw it in theaters because the sound and visuals are pretty amazing for what it is (not action packed.) It's definitely not like a Christopher Nolan movie, think more like Titanic (which I thought was boring as well when I was a little kid.)",10,Oppenheimer
"Without further ado, ladies and gentlemen:
CHRISTOPHER NOLAN REACHED PERFECTION!The film is the masterpiece of art that cinema tends to be only on rare occasions. One of the rare occasions was on Interstellar, but here... here it went beyond. This is the purest perfection Nolan has achieved.Is a film that will revolutionize cinema, as will almost all films by the same director. The script is amazing, perfect! Makes 3 hours of film feel like 5 minutes!The performances are A-M-A-Z-I-N-G, even from the lead to the extra, everyone in the film deserves the biggest spotlight. My prediction, which will probably be correct, is that Oppenheimer will be the frontrunner for the next Oscar. The performance of everyone in the project brings immersion and many different compliments.The art and sound direction, then, doesn't just deserve applause, they deserve an entire orchestra of celebrations to them!I've already convinced myself that Cillian Murphy, Florence Pugh and Robert Downey Jr. Will be the Oscar winners for best actor, actress and supporting actor.The film revolutionizes, animates, excites...
this is art. This is cinema....that's Christopher Nolan.",10,Oppenheimer
"Not going to jump on the band wagon, and say that this film was exceptional, brilliant etc... . But I will say that it was interesting to see what went into building the atomic bomb seeing it from a different perspective... (as they have been many movies about the Manhattan Project). The actors, the script, the pace was great; however, the only negative I have for this movie is it could have done without the sex scenes. I am not a prude in any way, but these scenes were totally useless, and had no real bearing on the story telling.... In all honesty, it really seemed like just gratuitous sex to just tick a box for an r-rated movie. But it truly could have done without them. Other than that I thought it was a really good movie.",8,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer's fascination with the concept of a black hole or the theory of relativity are Nolan obsessions. He's dabbled in time, relativity and black holes before, just how was he going to make this history lesson so entertaining?I asked myself that question time and time again, I'd purposely put off watching any trailer or video beforehand, I promised myself I wouldn't spoil anything, I even went as far as going to the loo when the trailer came on before Mission Impossible.When the film started, it introduced two timelines and my mind went 'This is a definitely a Nolan film'.It not only surprised me, it surpassed all of my expectations. This film is and will forever be the highlight of his filmmaking in my eyes, the narrative is complicated, going in circles, detours and jumping back and forth and back again... the complexity in which the scenes were shown, how he puts so much emphasis on (and makes us believe or even feel) Oppenheimers emotional state throughout is absolutely astounding.As I said before, the narrative is complicated to say the least, even if you and I were history experts and the narrative was more linear, the governmental secrets, complicated science, speeches and world politics would make it uneasy to fully understand or appreciate without a little help. But, Nolan purposely made everything harder for himself here, that's why Nolan is so great at what he does, he takes something and doesn't care if it takes time to explain, he doesn't cut any corners to make it easier for the viewer and he certainly doesn't want you to fully understand everything straight away. He wants you to literally fall into this universe he creates whilst the story unfolds on screen. This is why we all adore his storytelling, he's a masterful director, one without a rival. Nobody else comes close.The film basically plays through three acts, with the last hour being the final act, the more Nolan act of the three, this is where he really plays on what came before and opens up that web of sorts. I'd love to dissect here, but that would spoil the whole film for those unfortunate enough to have not seen it yet.One of Nolans biggest trademarks is his use of cross editing and epic music, there's a very unique rhythmical, Operatic nature to how his films flow and how his editing works. Oppenheimer is up there with the likes of Inception and Interstellar, his editing is even more on point here. But, it hasn't always 'worked' though, Tenet overdid what mesmerised me with his previous films, the sound editing for that film was just awful, but Nolan definitely listened to the complaints and did a tremendous job with this.This is some of the best acting in a Nolan film, Cillian Murphy is incredible and so is Robert Downey Jr, that third act plays with the characters in an interesting way. Some Oscar nods here for sure...In Conclusion, it's as dense and awe-inspiring as his best films, an audiovisual masterpiece, one where he excels at what he is good at. Yet, it offers new challenges for him, as challenging as this was, he nailed it and is now a career highlight.This is a must see for anyone, you cannot and will not be disappointed. I'm still in a state of shock from those last minutes...If you've not watched this yet, I don't know what you're waiting for, get out there and watch!",10,Oppenheimer
"The story is about J. Robert Oppenheimer, lovingly called Oppie, who is (maybe) wrongfully suspected of being a security risk, a suspicion cunningly used by another man who doesn't like Oppie, and therefore Oppie loses his security clearance, but later the second man experiences consequences of his unjust behaviour. Oppie doesn't regain his security clearance but gets decorated, which makes his wife happy. In a sideline to the story several hundreds of thousands of civilians get killed by the bomb Oppie developed, which costs him (Oppie) at least a few nights of good sleep, earning him the title of crybaby by Harry S. Truman.",7,Oppenheimer
"After many hits and masterful films such as Interstellar & Inception, I always highly anticipated Nolan's movies.Tenet was a huge disappointment and you could see his style getting out of hand, overcomplicating filmmaking and making it not consumable by casual movie fans who want to enjoy a movie without having to watch it multiple times.Oppenheimer is one step worse, because it was a much simpler storyline which did not have a fancy backstory and unique concept, it was a story to be told. Nolan failed big in doing so. The storyline wasn't well communicated and the characters weren't introduced properly.3 hours could have been 100 minutes. He totally missed big opportunities as well.I don't plan on watching any more Nolan movies in the future. Huge disappointment.Poor movie overall.",4,Oppenheimer
"Coming back after watching Oppenheimer.Won't give any spoilers but man, what a masterpiece nolan has created.No fancy cgi, no modern transitions.Pure storytelling.Cillian Murphy is indeed the best choice for playing Oppenheimer.Not only his acting skills but he literally tells the story by his eyes.Rest of the cast also did justice with the movie.The only thing I felt that story took a bit more time to build than it normally should've.Just go watch it alone or with someone who wants to seek knowledge and love science and history.Don't expect any action sequences cause there aren't anyCan't wait to watch it again in Imax.",10,Oppenheimer
"The movie talks about the moral dilemma of making an atomic bomb, and that helps Oppenheimer, who is obsessed with quantum physics, learn about the atomic field by making an atomic bomb, but what makes him make the bomb is more than his scientific interests; it's about his ideological politics. The movie makes me think more about Oppenheimer as a politician than a scientist at the end of the movie.I think the movie is boring for me because it's longer than I want, but the story of Oppenheimer is not about entertainment; it's about politics and history, and you need to watch this film. I don't believe I will see a nuclear war, and that doesn't make the movie important. As I said, the movie is important for how civilizations think during war or even in peacetime; if you think the movie is about just nuclear war, that's not correct.The cinematography is remarkable; it's very clean. I haven't seen this high quality of cinematography; even Hoyte van Hoytema's previous work didn't look like that.The soundtrack by Ludwig Göransson is very technological, as in his previous works, and classical at the same time, and the theme reminds me of Vangelis's works, especially the soundtrack called ""Destroyer of Worlds."".",8,Oppenheimer
"I have now seen this movie twice, once in regular cinema and once in 1570 IMAX. Even though it was an outstanding movie in regular cinema, I highly encourage you to see it in 1570 IMAX. It wasn't just a completely different experience, it was eye opening how films can be shot and watched.The obvious is that Cillian Murphy will take home the Oscar for best Actor in a leading role because wow he just destroyed every single scene!I can't tell you who was the best support cast member because there were so many that deserve recognition from Downey Jnr to Gary Oldman as President Truman.After watching the movie the first time I researched more and more about these events and it actually made the second viewing more enjoyable! I recommend watching it first without researching anything and then diving deep into the story and watching it again!",8,Oppenheimer
"The film lays out a journey of humanity's character that which we've never recovered. Powerful evils are perpetrated by such noble ""idealism"" from either side & the ""good"" versus evil debates remain only for the winners to portray the virtues of their side. It's a sickening gut wrenching film of such unimaginable horrors behinds it's subject matter of 2 dropped bombs never explained nor given detail. Only by the films very existence will humanity have yet another example of humankind's ""art"" ego telling war horror for entertainment, no idealism, no whimsical warnings, instead this seems instead a truth. Our very worst imaginings are only outdone by those with the power & ego to forgo their soul to achieve anything for nothing but horror. :Macbeth Tomorrow Tomorrow Tomorrow....",9,Oppenheimer
"'Oppenheimer' - Riveting plot, stellar performances, and breathtaking visuals make it one of the greatest movies of all time!I can't stop thinking about its brilliant sound design, Ludwig Göransson's phenomenal background score, Nolan's Direction and the legendary performances!Robert Downey Jr. Simply stole the show.. His portrayal of Lewis Strauss was exceptional!Cillian Murphy finally got his chance to showcase his brilliant acting skills.. Could not have asked for a better person to play Oppenheimer...Jason Clarke's portrayal of Roger Rob was something that I was not expecting to be that great.. But it turned out that it was one of the best performances of this movie..It is a near impossible task to point out literally one single bad performance by any actor or actress in this movie. The casting of this movie is nearly immaculate.You need to be really attentive while watching this movie. If you'll divert your mind for a minute or two, you might miss out some important plot details.The visuals and sound design of this movie is top notch! Nolan wanted Zimmer to compose the soundtrack but he went with Göransson. And in my opinion, he did a phenomenal job.'Oppenheimer' has established a place in my 'Top 10 Favourite Movies Of All Time'.. This is a movie, which I will watch again and again and again.. for the rest of my life..",10,Oppenheimer
"If you're looking for a movie that has a great storytelling, amazing acting and the right amount of astonishing cinematography, you should not search any further. 'Oppenheimer' has it all. But if you're expecting a breathtaking piece of media, you should continue in your journey.Honestly, it is quite saddening that such a beautiful piece of media lacks something so important as is the spark of originality.As someone who comes from a nation that releases one big biopic in cinema per year, I have seen a lot of different artistic visions for this genre. Now, combine this with my love for psychological dramas and thrillers and you get a pretty solid base for understanding what I'm trying to say.As much as I loved all the physics talk, the contrasts between the inner world of Oppenheimer and the reality around him and the suspense, it was not something I've seen for the first time ever. After three hours, I was not leaving the cinema bored, yet, I was rather annoyed. Everywhere I looked were 10/10s, 9/10s, but I just felt like I'd watched a blank template filled with really cool words and sentences.Some might say ""omg, she does not understand, she does not know her film stuff"", but that's it...for 6 years of my life I've been preparing for studying at a film university (though unsuccessfully for practical reasons), I know the basics of film theory and I undertook some courses on the matter...and from film theory standpoint the movie IS basically immaculate, but that's all. Plain. Distant. Overhyped. Just another movie.Calling 'Oppenheimer' Christopher Nolan's best movie and maybe the best movie to ever exist is even over its beauty certainly an overreach and to be honest if you say this, I think you might need to see more movies.",8,Oppenheimer
"Another masterpiece created by the genius Nolan. Everything in this movie is top notch: The acting performances, the directing, the writing, the editing, the sound, the production, the cinematography, the score, even the make up and costume design.Nolan should get an oscar nommination for best director. Cillian Murphy should get an oscar nommination for best actor just for his eyes expression only :). Too many great supporting actors/actresses that should get oscar nommination too (RDJ, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Jason Clarke, even Gary Oldman, Rami Malek, Casey Affleck).This is a work of art in a movie format.",10,Oppenheimer
"The movie is so great , it takes time and you will feel the length of it but when all things come together it becomes one of the best move you'll ever see.If you hated breaking bad and felt like it was long , overrated and boring, you'll feel the same about Oppenheimer.The movie isn't the best Christopher movie but it's so amazing and worth watching, and I'm confused by the amount of people who compare it to Barbie.Come on guys I mean Barbie is a meme movie but not a movie that you can compare it to Oppenheimer like a real bomb was blown in this movie and you're going to compare it to a fantasy children movie ?Like be for real and rate to the normal standards.Another banger from Christopher Nolan.",10,Oppenheimer
"Based on the 700-page tome ""American Prometheus"", Christopher Nolan's three-hour biographical thriller about the 'father of the atomic bomb', J. Robert Oppenheimer, is no less of an epic.That is not to say that the movie is slow or takes its time: On the contrary, ""Oppenheimer"" suffers from a restless and rushed pace. Especially during the exposition, it feels as though Nolan was trying to cram all of Oppenheimer's life before the Manhattan project into a breathless sequence of inadvertently comical video clips - in the style of ""This happened in the previous episode"".It goes without saying that we do not deeply get to know 'Oppie' this way: Little do we learn about his formative years, his love of poetry, his deep-rooted anxieties and contradictions, his life-changing relationship with Jean Tatlock and his concomitant exposure to communism and politics at large. The movie fails to explore Oppenheimer's inner conflicts, motivations, and feelings... which makes him a rather distant and enigmatic protagonist.This rush might be forgivable if it somehow served to set up an intriguing narrative. After all, part of what makes Nolan such a mesmerizing director are his deeply original ideas that leave us stunned and contemplating the fabric of our existence: what defines our memories, our dreams or reality, or simply time? ""Oppenheimer"" does leave you slightly confused, but its tornado-like whirl of different timelines and perspectives revolves around a rather hollow narrative. Once the atomic dust settles, there is little left - nothing insightful we have learned about the quantum world and the nuclear bomb, about science and its societal responsibilities, about peace and war. Just a rather petty political intrigue.That is not to say that the movie is wholly unengaging. After all, one of Nolan's strengths is his visual style, and ""Oppenheimer"" showcases the director's mastery of the large screen and its effects. I didn't watch it at an Imax theater, but even in a cozier setting, one can marvel at the overwhelming cinematography. The movie also features some breathtaking scenes, such as the famous Trinity test, recreated with minimal CGI and a real explosion. Ironically, this is also just about the only moment where the audience are granted a moment of peace and quiet in the otherwise annoyingly ubiquitous and monotonous soundtrack.Christopher Nolan's impressive body of work has earned him seemingly complete artistic freedom from budgetary or other constraints. In recent years, he has used this to make increasingly bombastic and grandiose movies. However, I can't help wondering if this license is an unconditional blessing - or whether Nolan's true talents get somewhat drowned out by the temptation to create ever more expensive special effects and cast yet more stars. In retrospect, films like ""Memento"" or even ""Inception"" feel almost modest and focused.",7,Oppenheimer
"""Oppenheimer,"" directed by Christopher Nolan, is one of the most hotly anticipated movies of 2023... for reasons I don't really understand. Screenings nationwide are selling out, thanks in part to the recent #Barbenheimer double feature craze; critics and audiences are raving about the film, flocking to see it in Imax; but what is it exactly about the film that has people in such a frenzy? I wish I knew, because to be quite honest, ""Oppenheimer"" didn't resonate with me.The allure of ""Oppenheimer"" is threefold: 1) Christopher Nolan has garnered a dedicated fan base over the years, with a unique and often mind-bending approach to filmmaking; 2) The subject matter of ""Oppenheimer"" might contribute to its buzz, with the film delving into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a prominent figure in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II; and 3) The movie promises explosive, practical special effects that should have audiences cowering in fear when the bomb finally goes off. And as the film delves into the historical events surrounding the development of the atomic bomb, the meticulous attention to visual detail is aimed at immersing viewers into the momentous and world-changing events of the past. So, on one hand, I do recognize, and admire, the positives of this movie. On the other hand, ""Oppenheimer"" is still a three hour long film that is comprised of nothing but people having long, drawn out scientific conversations - which is both a strength and a challenge, depending on individual viewer preferences. For me, this aspect was a challenge.I honestly found this to be a boring movie, with only a handful of brilliant scenes throughout, all occurring in the final hour of the film. The testing of the bomb and the aftermath, the hearings and conversations therein, the bombing and the reactions to it - all of those sequences were bordering on masterful, thanks in part to the brilliant performances that permeate the film. However, the build up to these sequences mean that you'll be sitting through two hours of agonizingly incomprehensible - and often forgettable - dialogue.Listen, I didn't connect with, or care about, the conversations the characters were having about atoms and hydrogen and whatever else they were talking about, and I could not relate to the conversations that occurred in this film; some of my favorite movies are nothing but dialogue - but dialogue, to be entertaining, has to be sharp and exciting, relatable and dramatic, engaging and memorable. Well-crafted dialogue adds depth to characters, drives the plot forward, and keeps the audience invested in the story. In ""Oppenheimer,"" however, the dialogue only manages to put viewers to sleep... or at least it did in my case. And because ""Oppenheimer"" is a movie that is basically nothing but dialogue, and because the dialogue didn't manage to strike a chord with me, the majority of the movie fell flat.And that's about all I have to say about this movie, because I honestly wasn't a huge fan. Yes, the acting is good, as are the practical effects and the direction. But beyond that, nothing resonated with me personally, besides a handful of scenes during the final 60 minutes of the film. That said, I know I'm in the minority here with my opinion, so my recommendation is to go out and watch the film, because you'll probably enjoy it more than I did.",4,Oppenheimer
"This film is one of those in which you do not realize the time that passes, despite having extensive dialogues, it does not become heavy even for its 3 hours. If you like the history from the perspective of its protagonist and you have slight notions of context, you will like it. You don't need to be an expert in physics or history at all.With respect to the main character, it is important that he is not presented as a perfect person, since in many films of this standard style, defects are minimized, not here, Oppenheimer is shown as a sometimes ambivalent person, who sometimes Attimes he doubts his actions and sometimes he is surpassed in knowledge by hiscolleagues. I also think that the inclusion of Jean's secondary history and his false communist past was good since it supports the argument and serves as a common thread for the unfounded defendants about what it is a danger to the security of the nation.The inclusion of Einstein was risky, but it achieved its objective without falling into a classic caricature of it.Regarding the performances, R. Dawney Junior's was spectacular, sometimes unrecognizable and generated a real feeling of rejection as a true ""villain"" that he is and of course also to highlight the performance of Emily Blunt as the wife of Oppenheimer, his main support and defender at times when the protagonist was defeated and passive.In technical aspects, I think the explosion was overrated but not misleading since that exaggerated idea that would leave you breathless was installed by the fans themselves, the real emotion and tension was felt seconds before the explosion itself.When leaving the cinema I left a little disoriented since at times I felt that there were scenes that did not fit together and I am not referring to the changes in the timeline, but in those that respect Los Alamos.I thought there would be a scene of the explosion of the h-bomb in Japan, but it did not happen, at first I was disappointed, but I understood that the focus of the film would have been lost by transforming it into another war movie and that with the scene of the charred body.All in all, It's an excellent movie, but not Nolan's best.",9,Oppenheimer
"I would like to talk about the Oppenheimer movie after I entered the cinema today. Indeed, this movie is really an example of movies that are made for the cinema, not for the home. I would like to stress that this movie is not for all people. Yizenberg and many others, and all the details surrounding the Manhattan Project, whether announced or unknown, surprised me in the film and made me amazed that the film demonized America and its government. Literally, some of its people gather America in this movie. It was a demon. In a scene of Oppenheimer with the president of America after the Hiroshima and Nagasaki explosion, Oppenheimer tells the president, I feel that my hands are stained with blood. 250,000 people were on his neck, he felt about themselves and their suffering throughout his life, and in the end, his country fought him and made him a traitor, and at the end of his life they honored him after he accepted on himself that he was fighting with all those around him in order to only reduce the guilt that he felt. And I will not forget Oppenheimer Einstein's sentence when he said that there was an opportunity in the Manhattan Project that we are destroying the world with our invention. The truth is that we really destroyed the world, and the feeling of arrogance kept haunting him all his life. This movie is as sweet as it is, but it is dark and depicts the black history of mankind. Not only the future is the one that is full of injustice and corruption, not the past. I was afraid that he would fall into the point of drumming for America and filming it in the role of angel, like most directors, and I wanted him to at least take the field of neutrality, but it surprised me when he portrayed history as black as it is in the past after Germany's withdrawal and Hitler's suicide, and Japan was the salvation of itself, and this is how it will lose, but America also designed a nuclear strike to test it and show its strength.",10,Oppenheimer
"I watched it on imax and This is one if not the best theatre experience that I've ever scene
and i think at least you should watch it on a really biggest screen as possible because believe me this is a truly another experience that may have not seen before
nolan storytelling on it's peak but I understand that this film may be not everyone cup of tea
So don't be fool by any review you see
You must watch it and make your own thoughts about it.Nolan gives us a biographical film but by his own way
The film is such a horror and horrible in a good way , the impact that leaved me after watching it. Just a SHOCK
It's not just a great movie it's really beyond that
One of the most important film in this century . We are experiencing the consequences , fears, and dilemmas of the events narrated in the story so far.",10,Oppenheimer
"1 - An absolute stinker of a film, with no redeeming features. It's unlikely that any film will receive this score.2 - Oh, not great at all. Amongst the worst films ever made.3 - I won't be back, and am less than pleased I've just spent time watching this.4 - Very poor effort. Struggled through.5 - Mediocre. Nothing special at all, but not completely unbearable.6 - Tries hard. On its way to worthwhile.7 - Solid viewing. Can't complain - would recommend.8 - Cracking. Enjoyed immensely. But it takes a lot to get 9.9 - It takes a lot to get 910 - An absolute banger of a film. Couldn't be better. It's unlikely that any film will receive this score.",10,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer (2023) chronicles the true story of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), his involvement in the Manhattan Project, and the events that unfolded in the aftermath.Wow wow wow, where do I begin? Let's start with the cast shall we? Because they were exceptional. Cillian was marvellous throughout and RDJ (as Lewis Strauss) was seriously outstanding, especially towards the end in that one particular scene (you guys probably know which scene I'm talking about if you've seen the movie). Now I can see what people were talking about when they said his performance was Oscar-worthy. Cillian's is too to be fair, let me just make that clear. Even the likes of Emily Blunt (as Kitty Oppenheimer) and Florence Pugh (as Jean Tatlock) were genuinely amazing in their albeit smaller roles. And boy, I knew the cast was stacked but not this stacked. Many of the other supporting actors were fantastic too: Rami Malek (as David Hill), Tom Conti (as Albert Einstein), David Dastmalchian (as William Borden), Dane DeHann (as Kenneth Nichols), Benny Safdie (as Edward Teller), Alden Ehrenreich (as Richard Feynman), David Krumholtz (as Isidor Isaac Rabi), and perhaps more who I don't think are being given enough praise.The score. Oh my god the score. Huge credit to Ludwig Göransson because it was absolutely breathtaking, and it really got my heart racing. The VFX and SFX were mesmerising and utterly riveting, even if they were a little overdone in my opinion. The sound wasn't perfect though. Even though you could actually hear the dialogue in this film (unlike Christopher Nolan's other movies), I still would've liked the music to be a little quieter so that we could hear it more clearly. Also, some of the sounds were... weird. During the Trinity Test it sounds like someone's shuffling out of bed, I'm not exaggerating, I honestly think that's how they got the sound, but why not just use the actual sound?? As a result of Nolan's stupidity, it made me laugh during what was supposed to be perhaps the most intense scene in the entire picture. But I digress, since either way, I would still expect this to win the Best Sound and Best Original Score Oscars, that's how good the audio was, seriously.In case you're wondering if the movie drags, considering it's a 3 hour picture, for me I would say it does a bit during the closed hearing scenes after The Trinity Test, but I was so engrossed in the film that I was loving it regardless. Some people might say that the first hour or so where we get to know about Oppenheimer's background before joining the Manhattan Project drags too, but for some reason I loved it. There wasn't even anything in particular about that part of the movie that you would say was entertaining per se, but seeing it in the theater, added with the thrilling score in the background, I guess just made me feel so immersed that no matter what was on screen, I was relishing it.Just to warn you, this picture is not necessarily in chronological order. There's a lot of flash forwards and flash backs. Think of it as two different timelines, which Nolan switches between at various points in the movie. Nolan actually tries to make this clear at the start by numbering each timeline 1 and 2, but even then, the less eagle-eyed amongst you may struggle to get a complete grasp on things, so just make sure you're paying attention. I personally managed to understand what was going on and because of that I actually really liked the two timelines thing, it makes this feature stand out compared to any ordinary film. It also made me quickly realise that this isn't just about the tragedies caused by the Manhattan Project, which is what my impression was from the trailer. There's a reason it's called Oppenheimer. It's about him, his story, his perspective of the Manhattan Project, so it's good that this was made explicit from very early on.But why am I giving this a 9 and not a 10? Because this isn't what I expected. This isn't what I wanted from this feature. After the bombings, I wanted to see a lot lot more on Oppenheimer's realisation at the calamities he has caused. I wanted devastation. Instead, the events after were predominantly about the hearing, which is a shame. This picture really should've focused on the immorality and tragedy of it all. Yes, we did get a little bit of that, but not enough. I expected to feel emotional myself when going to watch this, but no. I'm slightly disappointed as a result, because I wanted to feel heartbroken, I wanted that hard-hitting impact which I was craving, but it never arrived.But having said all that, this was absolutely spectacular, a one-of-a-kind movie. You have GOT to watch this in cinemas before it is too late. It's an unmissable cinematic experience. I cannot stress that enough.",9,Oppenheimer
"**Possible Spoilers Ahead**Oppenheimer is part-metaphysical film, part-courtroom drama, part-biopic, part-IMAX experience, all personal storytelling about one man who changed the history of the world. It's easily 2023's most important movie, but also its most devastating. It evokes the horrors of World War Two flawlessly even though we never see a single bullet flying on-screen (but don't think there's 100% clean imagery in this biopic). It gets down and dirty with Oppenheimer's life as an up-and-coming scientist changing the course of warfare itself (even if it was out of desperation to outpace the Nazis on the atom bomb front).Oppenheimer is a horror movie without any of the 'creeps and ghouls' gimmick; it's real-world history on The Manhattan Project, and that itself is never easy stuff to confront. It's 2023's defining World War Two film, and still relevant in regards to America's modern paranoia over Russia. At 3-hours it takes its time with all the personal, political and scientific stuff; and the sound design also helps make the experience feel 'atomic' and transcendent of the 'physical' story at play (especially the shots of the atoms themselves colliding and banging).Oppenheimer is a blockbuster that's not easygoing stuff by any stretch of the imagination, but it's certainly going to be remembered for generations to come thanks to Chris Nolan's spectacle and respect for J. Robert Oppenheimer himself.Oppenheimer leaves you feeling like... it says all it needs to say, yet it leaves you with dread that, did all this madness really end when The Manhattan Project itself ended? Did we end the world as we know it? Who knows? The film implies... yes, we did.An uneasy experience but historically important and necessary for both cinema and history nuts alike. 5/5 stars. 10/10 IMDb points.",10,Oppenheimer
"Man I can't describe how I feel , I feel amazed, I feel sad , I feel emotional. I really wish to watch that movie again if could, like who wouldn't like that peace of masterpiece, Christopher Nolan never let you down when he directs a movie.that Man will be the best director to ever come in history. I can't believe what he did honestly. The film is perfect in many ways
The music in the background, the graphics, the acting prefromance from the actors , the filming. I'll be so sad if they didn't at least win 4 Oscars awards I'll be so f#ckin mad , at last I really do recommend to watch the film at least 2 times and yeah that's all.",10,Oppenheimer
"Don't watch this movie if you want to see how the first Atom bomb was made or the WWII ended.Watch it if you love brilliant dialogues. The dialogues are master piece and so is the switch from current time frame to the past and back.The characters have played their roles brilliantly. Murphy and Robert have done justice to their characters, so has Matt.The movie is long, 180 plus minutes and that is where it captures the details and the essence of the court room drama. Doesn't stay in one time frame for so long that you get bored and swaps to past frame to make it relevant and a bit confusing at the same time (don't get me wrong with confusing word as it might get tricky if you don't follow the dialogues).This is not Interstellar, so don't go expecting to see space crafts and bombs and fights. The fight is in the courtroom for everyone to see.",8,Oppenheimer
"The movie was ok. There were some cool scenes, great acting, fantastic cinematography, and excellent sound design.The problem I really had with the movie was the sex scenes. They felt out of place. It was shocking to say the least seeing that in the theater. I looked away to be honest because I didn't really want to see that. I don't think it was crucial to the story, there are certainly ways to imply what happened without explicitly showing things.I love Christopher Nolan's movies. I think he is a fantastic filmmaker. For me, this film just didn't hit the mark. I felt more taken out than anything because of some of the content. I still have mixed feelings and I'm not sure what to think.",6,Oppenheimer
"I am a HUGE Nolan fan. I love his films so you can imagine my excitement to have seen press reviews and booked to see this movie. I avoided trailers cos I wanted to be blown away.But... I was hugely disappointed! And I mean CATACLYSMIICALLY!!Acting is great, no doubt.The score is great, definitely.Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey junior deserve oscar nominations, absolutely!That's it. This film is almost like watching a documentary, that you've committed to (cos you want to learn something, and you like the subject matter) but then get bored halfway through, but still persevere hoping there's a huge payoff for your investment in time.Sorry folks but there really, really isn't. It's very fragmented, jumps around in time far too much..... but you'll still stay until the end in the hope that this Nolan film will blow your mind with some incredible last hour.... and you'll say '""Masterpiece""... but it doesn't.I left the cinema, texted my mate (I'd already arranged to see it in IMAX with him in a few days) and cancelled. Luckily he hadn't bought the tickets cos, even if he had, I'd have sent him the money but not gone. Huuuuge disappointement. For me anyway, and the two people I watched it with. They felt the same.And from what we witnessed, quite a few other people too.Make up your own mind tho.If you enjoy watching senate hearings, or study 20th century American history, then go see it. If you want to see an exciting Nolan movie then stay at home and watch any of his other films.I almost wish I'd have gone and, watched Barbie instead...... almost....",5,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer, a truly masterpiece movie made just for the big screen. Best movie of the year and one of the greatest movie of our generation. This movie is not for casual movie watchers (wasn't that obvious?) But fir those who know how to appreciate real cinema. This movie needs to be understood in a way u never did. You want horror and science in a three hours long movie? This is it. Can't explain the feeling it set off inside us. I had been waiting for this movie since it's announcement and I am not disappointed, the movie feels like its slow but once it's over it feels like nothing. It leaves a deep impact on you.",10,Oppenheimer
"This movie brings people to life! This movie made me feel like I was part of the whole story! If you go and watch it, please watch it in IMAX, cause the whole movie brings everything in the whole industry in prospective! I loved the performance of every single one of the actors/actresses and I think the whole cast is chosen precisely and perfect for the whole movie's context! I loved the whole history lesson lol, but I loved the most the thought of our scary world that we live in! We have to think more about the people in the world, than ourselves and other opinions and the light of the projectors! Go and watch it! You won't regret it!",10,Oppenheimer
"For a 3hr long film this movie doesn't drag at all. Oppenheimer flies by and the story is told very rapidly, building the tension so well while building towards the Trinity test. At first I didn't know how I felt about the speed but after watching the film in full I completely understand why Christopher Nolan made that choice. The performances are astonishing across the table with the standouts being Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr, and Emily Blunt. They are surrounded by a top tier supporting cast (some with only one or two scenes). Everyone knocks it out of the park and showed up knowing what they were expected to do.Every scene is intentional and I truly don't believe you could cut anything out of this movie and say it would be a better film because of it. The one minor gripe I have is related to the character Jean played by Florence Pugh. I would have loved to see more of that relationship. As it stands, it wasn't the most impactful and I believe some scenes would have benefited emotionally if that character was given some more screen time. This will be one of the most remembered films of the year and I will be shocked if it isn't nominated in nearly every category at the Academy Awards. Bravo Nolan, Bravo!",9,Oppenheimer
"I've been waiting for this movie for like two years ever since the very first news broke. Cillian Murphy has made a deep impression on me as Thomas Shelby and I knew how he had insane screen presence. It's not often you see a movie that you've been anticipating for years. There's very few directors like Chris Nolan (perhaps none) who can pull people to the theaters the way he does (I watched a 2pm Saturday movie in a small-ish town and the cinema was packed).My experience with Oppenheimer was largely positive, which is a feat considering how much anticipation I had going in and was well aware of the widespread praise it was receiving. It truly was a cinematic experience and a very maximalist movie in a sense. The ensemble cast consisting of Murphy, Blunt, Damon, Downey, Pugh (although her role was not super significant) and many other recognizable faces, worked well and nobody dropped the ball. I would love to see Cillian win Oscars for this movie because portraying a complex character as Oppenheimer with such weight is a monumental feat. The audiovisual experience was quite top notch with Ludwig Gorasson and van Hoytema for music and cinematography. The one scene where Oppenheimer gives a speech after the bombing was one of the most disturbing scenes I've seen on cinema in a while.In a way, Oppenheimer is a near perfect movie. Its 3h runtime surprisingly did not feel long and I was a little sad that the movie ended. My one complaint about the movie is that it's almost TOO maximalist. The movie's source material was Oppenheimer's 700 page biography called ""American Prometheus"" and the movie did condense that into a movie. It felt like the movie was on full gas for 3 hours (especially the score barely ever actually stopping for 3 hours). There was no loose moment, no room for breathing and was overall very fast-paced that was almost hard to keep up, especially with so many events and characters. This does make me think that multiple viewing of this movie will help better appreciate it but it will definitely lessen the magic of viewing it for the first time.I love movies that embody the art of subtlety and Oppenheimer was not that. It was dramatic for all of its duration and that worked successfully for me as I was completely engaged in the movie for that long. But I wish that the writing was trimmed a bit more and spent more time in key moments instead of rushing through them. The 4.5 I am giving is a 4.5 that's very close to a 5 but I just couldn't feel the same way. I do want to make clear that it was an amazing experience and worth the hype. It just was not a 5 movie for me.",9,Oppenheimer
"They are movies that ""make"" themselves. Then they are actors who ""make"" movies. Finally, they are directors whose recognizable style and cinematic experience ""make"" an awesome movie.Christopher Nolan has established himself as one of those directors. The cinema I went to was packed, although it has already been out for a week as of the time of writing. This is remarkable.With ""Oppenheimer"", he has achieved an intimate as well as grand artistic blockbuster.At first, I had slight skepticism when I heard that Nolan would make a biopic. But any doubt was atomized by this masterful film talking in a genuinely creative way about the notorious ""father of the atom bomb"", a rather undesirable attribute.The biographical nature of this film finds itself woven into a creative narrative construct, which does not cover the entirety of Oppenheimer's path. Many movies like to market their depicted characters or story as world-changing and of singular importance, but this rarely is true. Oppenheimer, as the creator of the first large-scale ultra-lethal mass destruction weapon, which had historical, scientifical, geopolitical, and psychological consequences up to this day is no doubt one where the designation is, let's say, quite fitting.The storytelling has one slight issue. An issue that was also found in Nolan's ""Tenet"". Nolan overrates the smartness of his viewers. Or, seen from a different perspective, is just too smart for us. At least some of us. Think of the way he often presents characters or historical events without a proper introduction. Or some historical events are presented. But one can not criticize a movie for being too sharp, or can one? This is also adequate considering the brilliance of the physical mastermind, polyglot, articulate Robert J. Oppenheimer.I liked the way the movie also depicted the flaws (infidelity, mental issues, regrets) of its titular character.What I found interesting, too, was that the length of the film did not feel like a tiresome three hours due to the fast pace of it.As to be expected, the cinematography (when was it ever less-then-splendid in Nolan films ?), the VFX, the production design, and the music are top-notch. Goransson's energetic soundtrack considerably adds to the engrossing nature of the film.More than ever, the ensemble of this film is really something: Damon, Branagh, Blunt, Downey, and much more. Of all these, Murphy leaves the best impression with his theatrical meticulousness. The Oscar nomination is inevitable, hopefully.I was also surprised, furthermore, by some scenes unrecognizable for Nolan, like the use of black and white or the shockingly revealing sex scene, that came a bit out of nowhere.Visually striking, fascinatingly, and creatively told, qualitative in all existing cinematic departments, Nolan did it again. It feels real and meaningful, as any good movie should.I eagerly await Nolan's next film which shall undoubtedly be a new awe-inspiring cinematic experience.",10,Oppenheimer
"The movie is awesomI advise anyone to see a movie whose story is universal and sweet. Cillian Murphy excelled in the character of Robert Oppenheimer And I will go to watch it on the 21st in Iraqi cinemas. The movie is awesome and very strong. I recommend it. The strength of the movie gives you an experience of art and hardshipI don't know why this legendary work is being compared to the failed Barbie movie Opheimer will win an Oscar, an integrated film in all respects, a historical and biographical film I advise you to watch it in IMAX cinemas Don't forget to add me on Instagram, my name a.dq4.",10,Oppenheimer
"Movie was released on the 19th in my country. In my opinion, it is the most important film Nolan has ever made. I had goosebumps during THAT part in the middle of the movie and at the end. No viewing experience could have given me that suffocating and colossal feeling than in the cinema. The music score, the cinematography, the acting, everything about it is sublime. I sank in my seat and for a good 5 minutes after it ended, none of the people I watched it with made a move. We just kind of sat there in silence, at a loss for words. See this on the big screens. It's an incredible, haunting piece of art and cinema at its finest.Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt are outstanding in this. The cast was just stellar.",8,Oppenheimer
"Profoundly poignant and introspective, ""Oppenheimer"" condenses the critical aspects of one mans life and internal struggles, into a three hour movie, which is challenging to watch. Christopher Nolan is a master at conjuring up wild fantasies, but in ""Oppenheimer"" he needed to stay grounded. He needed to take the works of other writers and treat the story with the respect it deserves. On one hand, the film is a masterpiece, due to how Nolan presents Oppenheimers personal struggle, having invented the means to our own demise. On the other hand, it's a Christopher Nolan movie and his wildly outlandish and incoherent methodology of telling stories, feels like a child's finger painting when looking at the material he has to work with. Its clear there wasn't enough conflict during the rise of Oppenheimer, being the lead scientist at Los Alamos, so Nolan came up with a clever, all be it challenging to understand, method of creating some sort of through narrative which binds the three hours together. For better or worse, as the story unravels, it gets further and further engrossing and by the end, you honestly want more. You'll be hard pressed to find a filmmaker who doesn't smile when the audiences biggest complaint, is a three hour biopic, not being long enough.The film is helmed by quite an incredible all-star cast, with award winning guys doing bit parts like Kenneth Branagh and Rami Malek. Cillian Murphy is so deadpan the entire film, he's so emotionless, even in moments of distress, it's hard to connect with his performance. Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Robert Downy JR, the ""main"" cast of the film, were all much more rounded performances and honestly, steal the show from Cillian unfortunately. Robert clearly wants an Oscar and his performance is worthy. It was a fantastic role for him, one of the best I've seen in years. Blunt is always good and her character is so haunting, she almost feels like a schizophrenic, which is kind of what the real person was like. Of course who can go wrong with Matt Damon, the part was very simple and he did an admirable job. But gosh, poor Cillian, I feel so bad. He had two great opportunities to show some emotion and Nolan clearly felt it didn't work, as they were left on the cutting room floor. Was he the wrong pick? Without seeing his full range on screen, it's hard to tell. I just know without the tremendous supporting cast, mostly award winners in their own right, Cillian would not have been able to hold it, staring at the camera with that deadpan look.To say this film is an ""IMAX"" movie, is disingenuous to the audience. Not only is there basically no major IMAX scenes in the movie, but it takes way from the story. The vast majority of the film is shot with Panavision 5 perf 65mm cameras, which his a widescreen 2.20:1 aspect ratio format. Harkening back to ""The Dark Knight Rises"", which was mostly shot on 35mm Anamorphic. The 2.20:1 aspect ratio IS the aspect ratio the film was edited in and this is what all of the dialog scenes are shot with. So the ""IMAX"" version of the film, jumps between aspect ratio's nearly every scene. There were some pretty full 15P 65mm IMAX shots between the 5 perf scenes, but they were a distraction. The film would have been still awesome as a 2.20:1 aspect ratio film, designed to fill the 1.90:1 aspect ratio ""digital"" IMAX screens. The CLEARLY photochemical timing was poor, reminiscent of Dunkirk, which I thought on film was one of the poorest examples of photochemical timing made in the modern era. Nolans last film ""Tenet"" looked outstanding because it had a DI (digital intermediate) finish, where they scanned the negative, colored it digitally and recoded it back to film. This is the ""normal"" workflow that's been used since the early 2000's for nearly all movies, outside of Christopher Nolan and Paul Thomas Anderson, who both prefer the look of photochemical timing. However, when the timing is poor, the audience complains about the cinematography, which is something I've seen so many people do with Dunkirk and Oppenheimer on their own reviews. Worst yet, was the black and white scenes, printed to color stock. Oh gosh, what an egregious thing to do. Not only were they green, I mean straight green, but they were mostly timed wrong. Either too dark or too bright. There was such an unevenness to the timing over-all, it wasn't nearly the IMAX prints of Dunkirk bad, but it was damn close.Hoyte van Hoytema's work is outstanding in ""Oppenheimer"". The film features a lot of complex dialog scenes and keeping them interesting with framing and blocking, with set design and lighting, was very tricky. Editing played a key role as well, but I always look at what was shot day-of and Hoyte and his crew just nailed it. Where they wanted to be more intimate with the camera, they'd push for wider angle lenses and hand held. When they wanted to be more removed, looking in from a distance, they'd switch to dollies and sticks, with an IMAX shot here or there mixed in for fun. I don't even recall seeing a crane or jib shot in the entire film, it was either hand held, dolly or sticks. You can tell they were shooting fast, lots of complex scenes, which have to evoke emotion, which need to be understood by the viewer. This is where the editing comes in and where I prefaced this review with the finger painting Nolan does with the incoherent story telling methodology, there were A LOT of editing issues with the movie. Scenes that needed to breathe a few frames more, cut off sometimes mid dialog. Major continuity issues with other characters in scenes mouths moving, but not the right dialog coming out. One moment near the end, where a hand full of frames were missing mid shot! Clearly someone who was cutting the negative screwed up. But mid shot? The technical aspects of post, over-all were a bumbling mess sadly. Even Ludwig Göransson's score was unimaginative and completely forgettable, which was a real shame. The audio mix (always a problem in Nolan films), ruins any ability for the audience to enjoy the score. It's always a struggle to hear the dialog to a point where you just want the score shut off.I feel ""Oppenheimer"" is a quandary of a movie. What he wrote, is an excellent piece of cinema. However, once he ""Nolanized"" the finished product, I think it looses much of its power and intimacy. It goes from a character study to a showpiece for the directors reel. Part of the entire point of this film, is the debate of whether Oppenheimer himself should be credited with the Atomic bomb, or is it the people who gave him the money and dropped it on Japan. The film tries so hard to show how Oppenheimer struggled with the very concept of building a civilization ending weapon, that the world would never be the same once it was dropped on Japan. That Oppenheimer was more than just a scientist, but also someone who should be commended for his desire never to see the bomb used. But the film puts too much emphasis onto Christopher Nolan and his unusual story telling method, along with technical issues, which do not plague other filmmakers of this caliber. It's a travesty because all of us Nolan fans (which I am absolutely one) really felt this could be where Christopher Nolan finally is recognized for his work by the academy. He had all the elements, but he blew it, simply because he couldn't be mature enough. He couldn't pull a Quinten Tarantino. He couldn't just make an adult movie. He sure tried, no doubt the material exists to make an award winning film. What I saw however, was a flawed film which was only saved by a phenomenal supporting cast and a final act, which was not only an extremely powerful message, but also reminds us how nuclear proliferation will eventually be our undoing as a society. Some may argue that Oppenheimer is Nolan's greatest work, but I still think the genius of ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"" can't be beat. Oppenheimer will do very well in the box office, it will make up for Tenet's Covid release debacle, but I will struggle with sleep tonight, thinking what could have been.As a side note, I highly recommend NOT seeing this film on 70mm IMAX. Complete waste of time. Watch it on ""standard"" 70mm or 35mm. There are over 100 prints like that in ""normal"" theaters and the experience SHOULD be better, all be it, still green black and white scenes. I'm sure the digital version is not much better with that aspect, but honestly I feel the digital presentation version of the film, maybe the best way to see it.3.5/5.",10,Oppenheimer
"This movie is a masterpiece , I could not find a flaw with it .The acting of this movie was the star , the story , cinematography and direction co star .What can you say about such a serious subject and defining moment in human history . Well Nolan and the cast delivered a fantastic representation of this time .I recommend this movie it is a grand scale cinematic experience .Cillian will get Oscar , Matt Damon , Robert Downy JR. All deserve Oscar's .Every part played to perfection the supporting cast was just brilliant .The sets just perfect .This is movie making as it should be .",6,Oppenheimer
"The love for this movie is very perplexing. I keep reading words like ""masterpiece"" to describe it and I just don't see it. What I saw was a disjointed mess! No character development and very poor story telling. I suppose its erratic quality was intentional on the part or the director (perhaps to help us into the mind of Oppenheimer), but it most certainly didn't land for me. I checked the clock a lot. Had I been watching it on streaming, I'd probably have turned it off after the first 30 minutes or so.A lot of folks seemed to have problems with the sex scenes, saying they didn't add to the movie. I actually disagree. I felt the sex scenes stressed Oppenheimer's immature attitude toward women and really his general attitude towards others. I suppose this could have been accomplished without nudity, but I thought the sex scenes made sense in the context of an otherwise confusing narrative.I suppose the acting was decent, but the script was so boring it gave the actors little to work with. It felt so emotionless and lifeless to me. Most of Nolan's work feels that way to me. Even Murphey seemed bored by the role and not always sure of the character he was playing. Emily Blunt had that pointed scene towards the end, but for the most part, I was unsure of her character and her place in the film. I'd have been curious to see this same story told by Aaron Sorkin or Ron Howard or Wolfgang Peterson. Bottom line - snore. In fact I think I did doze off a few times.",4,Oppenheimer
"The movie was NOT about the Manhattan Project!!The core of the movie turns out to be about Lewis Strauss personal vendetta against Oppenheimer!!I don't mind a good political drama about vengeance. The problem was that the political drama in the movie was not interesting at all. It was a bore!! Frankly the Oppenheimer-Strauss hostilities are not an interesting subject.I did not care about the Oppenheimer hearings. The movie tries to create some twists and intrigue but it did not work. It does not matter how much dramatic music you put in scenes it still did not work.Nolan is good adding dramatic music to enhance scenes that, in reality are mundane.To make things worse the movie editing was terrible! The movie kept jumping from scene to scene in a hurry with not connection between them. We don't know anything about the time and location between scenes!The editing is so fast and the scenes are so short and all over the place that the characters don't have time to breath! The characters development was an afterthought!At the end I did not care about any character!If you expect a movie about science this is not it. If you expect a movie about the process and sacrifices of creating the Manhattan Project, the process of creating the atomic bomb with all the science trials and errors this is not for you.At least 70% of the movie is about politics. The movie spends maybe 45-50 min total in the Manhattan Project.The only positive things about the movie is the great cast.",9,Oppenheimer
"This was an amazingly shot movie. Most if not all are practically shot without the use of vfx which I find quite amazing when visualising the thought process of Oppenheimer.I recognised most actors even in small rolls which was quite amazing. Just shows that many actors wanted to be part of this amazing work.Murphy puts in an amazing performance which so far I expect to do put him in contention for an Oscar for the leading actor position. I also suspect RDJ might walk away with a best supporting actor, if not he should definitely be on the nomination list.All the actors did a fantastic job. The cinematography was amazing and the direction.Some people complained about the dialogue, but I could hear everything fine.This film kept me engaged for the entire runtime.",8,Oppenheimer
"Like everyone else I was pretty hyped up for Oppenheimer, the latest flick from Christopher Nolan based on the 2005 biography ''American Prometheus'' by Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin. And after watching it, I think it's safe to say it met almost all of my expectations. From a technical perspective, the film is brilliantly well made. The sound design, production design and the breathtaking cinematography are all top notch. On top of that it also has one of the best scores of the year from Ludwig Görranson.Speaking of the performances, Cillian Murphy IS Oppenheimer. His line delivery, acting and chemistry with the other actors felt so real and natural. Not to mention how identical he looks to the real J. Robert Oppenheimer. But the real star is Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss. Aside from the lead actor he gets most of the screentime and boy did he chewed it up. His expressions, line delivery and particularly the third act meltdown are brilliant. The rest of the cast does a pretty good job especially Benny Safdie as Edward Teller. Just like the title the movie primarily focuses on J. Robert Oppenheimer and his role in developing the atomic bomb. The movie gives him a proper structure and development and is fully fleshed out.Even though the film is brilliantly well made with fantastic performances from the cast, I couldn't help but feel like it dragged on. Now I was really invested in the first 2 hours but as the final hour approaches I was starting to somewhat lose my interest. If only it was trimmed a little then it could've been perfect. Another issue I have with the film is that it completely sidelines the female characters ( just like other movies from Nolan ) Kitty Katherine Oppenheimer, played by Emily Blunt and Jean Tatlock, played by Florence Pugh. They are being setup in the beginning and then are almost completely forgotten until the final hour kicks in. Especially Blunt who should've gotten more screentime as she's supposed to play Oppenheimer's mistress. They could've easily explored more about Oppenheimer's personal life as well. This felt like a missed opportunityOverall, Oppenheimer is a brilliantly well crafted film from Christopher Nolan that depicts one of the most eerie, intense, haunting and terrifying events in the history of mankind and is easily one of the best biopics/historical movies of all time. Even though the movie is 3 hours long and might test your patience it is a chilling experience nonetheless. You do not want to miss this.",10,Oppenheimer
"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer may be the most expertly crafted and intelligent movie I've seen in the past decade. The scope of the film was ambitious, but if there's anyone that can do it, it's Christopher Nolan. The visuals are almost all practical and it pays off, this movie is stunning to look at from the first frame to its last. The cinematography also plays a part in this. The cast, acting, and dialogue are all perfectly selected, acted, and written. Specifically, the acting from Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh are all phenomenal. The pacing is fantastic though once you get to the court scenes towards the end of the movie it can drag a little, but it's nothing drastic The message of the movie being ""just because you can do something doesn't always mean you should"" is perfect for Robert Oppenheimer's story. The movie is great in IMAX just like Nolan promised, though I don't believe it is necessary to get the full experience of the movie like he said. The reality is, I don't see any obvious negatives to this film so this is a rare 10 out of 10 movie for me, and I hope everyone gets to go see it.",10,Oppenheimer
"Drama thriller at its best very best ; editing and cinematography and all technical aspects of the movie is in greatest standards, character arc and screenplay is fascinating ,brilliance written all over it !Acting master class; that's one word to describe the movie , it will take a lot of space to describe everyone, so am mentioning the ones impressed me most; matt damon is perfect and emily blunt is pretty good and best of Josh Hartnett to me ,Alden Ehrenreich is impressive and Florence Pugh is simply sensational !And Robert Downey Jr ; excellency of acting ,one of his best work till date ! And the man who relived as OPPENHEIMER ; Cillian Murphy is mind-blowing !!!Now lets talk about the MAIN GUYIF A name of a director and his style of making outshine everyone and everything about the movie then his name must be Christopher Nolan !! If you love his cinemas ,you will adore this ! Like he said ""don't try to understand it, just feel it ""yeah just feel the Unparalleled Cinema Experience !!",8,Oppenheimer
"Every character well developed and human, not cookie cutter 'cut outs' or stereotyped by race, religion or profession. Attention to detail in every respect IE the images are stunning . Production design , IE sequence of events and the acting and direction could not be better. Oh . . . A script developed by the Film MakeR from . . . A . . . BooK ; in other words good writing. Human drama taken from real life can be more dramatic and interesting than fictional scripts. IMO the film is 1) a stunning achievement and 2) very much worth the three hour length to see it. You won't find yourself saying , 'this movie is too long' as so many are these days. My one warning and criticism is that in some scenes the dialogue is not even intelligible due to so much other sound in the back round. Highly recommended otherwise.And please , as always , remember to ignore the 'one and done' 'reviewers' here.",8,Oppenheimer
"I'm not especially into biopics - the stories are formulaic by nature, and executing the beginning/ending is never easy (which usually means the middle suffers as a result). ""Genius encounters challenges and overcomes"" can only be so interesting. Enter Christopher Nolan, who uses ALL his tricks to make this film something more than just Oppenheimer's life. And it works. The editing, the time jumps, the sense of chaos, the awe-inspiring cinematography...it all adds stakes over and over. The first two hours just rocketed by. By the time they strapped on their goggles, I was somehow on the edge of my seat for a bomb test with a fairly predictable outcome. The third act dragged a bit, but this was still quite a feat. It's not my favorite Nolan film, but it felt like a maybe the fullest expression of his filmmaking. And I'm glad someone is making movies like this.",8,Oppenheimer
"I walked out of Oppenheimer satisfied, but with many questions and ears slightly more deaf than when I walked in. I was looing forward to seeing this movie since last year, and could not wait to go and view it. However, there are a couple things that decreased the enjoyment of this movie for me.Firstly, the musical score throughout the movie was more unimpressive than I would've liked. In Interstellar, the musical score is beautiful, captivating, emotional and helps the viewer further build and extend on the emotions they are already feeling. I cannot say the same for this movie. It was WAY too loud, and it wasn't fitting. I felt that the music would be randomly chucked into scenes in an attempt to build on emotion- but there was no emotion to start with so it was completely ineffective. How am I supposed to understand the movie if I cannot hear half of the dialogue?The explosions were fantastic, and Nolan's cinematography was perfect as always. I found that I was more emotional about the beauty of some scenes than the actual story itself. It did lack emotion, but I feel that if I were to sit here and criticize it I would be wrong. It is a very complicated, intricate story and it is extremely hard to incorporate history in an emotional way when there is so much to it. It would've been hard to say the least, especially since a Historical biographical drama such as this one is new to Nolan's style. The ending scene was captivating and perfect.The cast was ridiculously good, and I could not say there was not a moment where I thought the acting quality dipped. A convincing performance from everyone, and I was quite impressed at Robert Downey Jr's performance. He is sure to win an Oscar.I did find that the visual representation of the growing psychological burden that weighed heavily on Oppenheimer was exceptional, with the drumming combined with the shaking background perfectly conveying the detachment and dehumanization that he was experiencing. Also a very relevant movie to what I am currently learning about in History.A long movie, but it definitely needed the time to explain. However, I do agree that there was not much backstory, and that Nolan instead placed us right into the plot. I found myself searching up information after the movie to gain better insight into the characters and their lives.A great watch, it IS worth the 3 hours. Will require a second watch, but overall extremely impressed with Nolan's work.",9,Oppenheimer
"If you have even a passive interest in the subject or the politics behind the topic, uts a good movie. Casual viewers may get lost.The story was chaotic with many characters to follow. And tge editing style.made it difficult at times to follow. Alot of jumping around.And the score overshadowed the dialog at times. So loud it seemed out of place.It's kind of like Dunkirk. Very underwhelmed considering the hype. For instance, the size and scope of the Los Alamos town wasn't portrayed very well, kind of like how the size and scope.of Dunkirk evacuation fell flat.Good not but not great. Enjoyed it but wouldn't see it again.",7,Oppenheimer
"Ocean's Eleven, but with scientists. Perhaps Nolan even included the line 'I am assembling a team' as a very suave, subtle reference to the heist genre... my god the man is a genius.Starts out with protagonist suffering from PC screensaver visions which are discarded after the first 15 minutes of the movie. This was clearly meant to prove the supreme profundity of the main character.Entire movie is disjointed, moves far too quickly for the characters or their relationships to properly develop for the viewer. BAM! Another A-list actor! BAM! Another one. BAM! BAM!Are you impressed yet?Einstein figures as a sort of fairy god mother. Very tropey.I have the feeling that Nolan was going for some Usual Suspects vibe at the end with the twist of the character of Robert Downey Jr. Being 'ze bad man'. Sorry, but it was convoluted, overly long and emotionally unpersuasive. Bureaucratic procedures are very hard to make exciting - and I am a lawyer.However, Cillian nails Oppenheimer. One just has to watch interviews with the man. The cadence of speech, voice, posture. Well done. But: not utilized fully. All Murphy is asked to do is stare with wet eyes into the camera, in autistic reverie or horror.Seriously, in my opinion, only one single scene was captivating, which was the one where Oppenheimer was interviewed by Colonel Commiehunter. If the entire movie tried to capture the atmosphere of that single scene, we would have had a fantastic film.Ending was such an overly dramatic nothing whaffle.Worst Nolan movie i have seen - this was the first one where about halfway, I wanted it to end.",5,Oppenheimer
"So Oppenheimer is undoubtedly one of the most anticipated movies of the year by many people including myself, a Nolan epic people wait for and it delivers, not without some flaws but the types of flaws don't carry nearly as much weight as the positives.Oppenheimer is about a period in J Robert Oppenheimers life, gathering with some of the greatest minds in Physics, Oppenheimer must build a bomb for the US army so they can win world war 2. We get to see his personal life and the struggles of being one of the smartest men alive.I think the pacing for the first 2 hours was great, not a second felt dragged, we are constantly bouncing from one scene to the next, showcasing the internal panic of meeting his deadline and what it must be like being as fast paced within his mind.The score FANTASTIC, the cinematic shots are beautiful and that you expect, there are these shots of atoms and other forces at times when he speaks that we're so great.The supporting cast were all fantastic, so man amazing actors in this, Florence was okay, I found her purpose to the film was okay, her acting was fantastic, Matt Damon was great, showing his development to Opp, Emily blunts character had a nice arc within the movie, RDJ was fantastic and knowing nothing about Opps life made it sweeter as the movie went on, but Cillian was the man of the hour, FINALLY, he was incredible and held the movie on his shoulders, his emotions are great, his assurance and contemplation are fantastic scenes.The 3hr runtime was a little much as the last 40-1hr felt like it lost momentum, I loved the scenes but their pace made me lose the feeling I had for a long while, other than that, I loved it, not sure it I will rush to see it again but it's a fantastic movie, 8.5/10.",9,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer (2023), directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Cillian Murphy in the titular part, is that rare production where everything - everything - works.J. Robert Oppenheimer (called Robert, called 'Oppie', never called Julius) is the central figure of a story that is larger than any person; the heart of which beats at the temperature of approximately 300,000 degrees Celsius; the successful resolution of which threatens to swallow the world. Making a film that doubles as a biography of the atomic bomb and of its 'father' is a tall order, yet Nolan does the subject justice.Covering the expanse of thirty-seven years, from 1926 to 1963, the picture presents a non-linear sequence of events. The narrative moves to and fro between two hearings: that where the matter of Oppenheimer's security clearance is debated; and that where Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) is to be confirmed by the Senate as Secretary of Commerce. The latter plot-line may be unexpected, but it serves to expose the political machinations at work and, ultimately, links Oppenheimer's roles as a scientist and laboratory director to his personal life and his legacy.The performances by Murphy and Downey Jr. Are outstanding, with the rest of the ensemble cast (Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh et al. Et al.) shining in their parts. Damon, in the role of General Leslie Groves, the officer directing the Manhattan Project, provides a welcome foil for Murphy's Oppenheimer, with the two sharing some of the best dialogue in the film. Pugh and Blunt, in the roles of Oppenheimer's lover and wife respectively, are striking and memorable in their own right.The cinematography by Nolan's frequent collaborator Hoyte Van Hoytema effortlessly oscillates between the minute and the colossal. The decision to forego computer-generated special effects - in favour of practical methods and recreation of historical settings - lends the picture authenticity that is rare in the CGI-saturated world of Hollywood blockbusters. The original score composed by Ludwig Göransson is the nerve of the story, skilfully guiding the audience from 'the highest high, to the lowest low'.Oppenheimer is a work of cinematic art. It may deal with one of the darkest chapters in American history, yet its effect is that of profound enlightenment, of an experience surpassing one's immediate life, of an immersion into a world that is supranatural, arranged, distilled, concentrated - yet real. It is best seen at a theatre; perhaps, multiple times at that.",9,Oppenheimer
"This film is brilliant. The movie is 3 hours long but it felt more like 2 to 2 and a half hours. It can be a bit overwhelming sometimes, and I definitely recommend to do a bit of research of who Robert. J. Oppenheimer was. It's also a film that you need to pay really close attention to, you could easily miss something. The audio is perfect and I didn't have any problems with hearing the voices of the characters, I watched this in IMAX by the way and I definitely recommend the reader to also watch it in this format. You can't expect action from this movie because if you do you will be disappointed, the film contains mostly scenes of the person's talking, but Nolan manages to even let scenes like this feel thrilling. The acting performance is magnificent, probably the best of 2023, Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey jr. Were brilliant. The visuals were also very impressive considering the fact that they didn't use any CGI this whole movie. The fact is that this film is objectively good even though I'm not a film expert of any sorts, and I definitely recommend to watch it (In IMAX if possible).",10,Oppenheimer
I walked out of the cinema in complete awe. The movie had some of the best and most bone chilling cinematography and audio I have ever witnessed. The IMAX experience was out of this world and Christopher Nolan's choice to spend all the time and resources to film in this format was the best decision he possibly could've made. The sound and size of the picture gave it a magnitude like no other. The acting was phenomenal and Cillain Murphy's performance was out of this world. Not a single person in the world that could play the role any better. This movie is a work of art and a definitive Oscar and award winning masterpiece. Easy ten stars.,10,Oppenheimer
"Nolan is my favorite director, second to none. I just love all his movies and I don't think there is a bad movie in his CV.He is a real man because he makes the movies exactly the way he wants them, using the best possible technology at that moment for a real experience on the big screen, the way movies should be seen.On the one hand, this is a slightly different film in his career. A three-hour biographical drama with no effects, no CGI, no big twist at the end of the movie is something we haven't seen from Nolan since... well, never. On the other hand, he stayed true to himself by using his signature and style, so we can see part of the film in black and white, that is, part of the action, the non-linear flow of the story, a great interest in physics, we have seen all of this to a certain extent in his films, such as Interstellar or Memento. I was delighted with the final product because, theoretically, I would not have been drawn to the cinema by a biopic about an American scientist who invented the atomic bomb, and on top of that, it lasts for three full hours. At no point was the film boring to me, I did not feel its true duration. That's a big compliment.Right at the beginning, I noticed that the film will have a lot of text because, as expected, there is a lot of dialogue, but these dialogues take place at a slightly higher speed, there are not many breaks. This was fine with me because it drew my attention to follow more closely. To be honest, I didn't check this later, I'm just giving my personal impression. Also in the film there are a lot of events and characters over a long period of time, there are no unnecessary scenes, things change and I think that this contributed to the film holding attention throughout its duration.The cast of the film is quite strong and diverse, and Cillian Murphy, who portrays the title character, had a career role, and I predict an Oscar nomination for him, at the very least. He carried the entire film on his back, and he is portrayed as a layered and complicated man, he is neither positive nor negative, he is neither good nor bad, but he has his virtues and flaws, his doubts and moral doubts, it is up to us as viewers to judge what he is like. Clearly, all of this would not be possible without the accompanying ensemble, which is also at the highest level. Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon and Emily Blunt deserve all the praise who are in the best scenes of the film, showing their pure talent when there is no green screen next to them. I must also say that the film has very, very many characters, some of whom are proven actors and Oscar winners who appear literally in a cameo role, one or two scenes for a minute or so and that's it. Obviously when Nolan does something then everyone clears their schedule to be a part of such a project. I won't mention who they are because I didn't know that myself, so I was positively surprised when I saw them in the movie.The film has several themes that it deals with and I think it balances them brilliantly. So we have biography, court drama, politics, history, physics, and moral doubts about whether something should be done just because it can be done. So much that I probably didn't manage to catch everything in one viewing, so I'm drawn to watch it again. In addition to all that, the film has a very important message.Nowadays, this film is exactly what we need when we are bombarded with various blockbusters and franchises with countless sequels and heavy effects. That I can watch something a little different in peace, and yet that it is visually beautiful, with a great sound and soundtrack. I understand that there will be a good portion of people who will not like this movie, but that is a topic for another discussion. The fact that a three-hour drama will manage to make money in theaters in this day and age speaks volumes. I predict several Oscars in various categories. A movie with a capital letter, the movie we needed, not the one we deserved.Thank you, Nolan!",10,Oppenheimer
"This has to be experienced in a cinema with high quality sound system. The sound plays a crucial role in the experience of watching this non-stop high paced movie. The movie is 3 hours long but did not feel like it, in fact I was surprised when it finished. It is a classic hit and keeps you on the edge of your sit. I would give the movie itself 9/10 but because of the amazing visuals plus sound editing, the cinematic experience elevates it so gets a rare 10/10 for me. The acting is superb. Murphy and RDJ give monstrous performances. If indeed Nolan is planning on making biographies, I am really looking forward to watching them because this was the best Nolan movie so far, well The dark knight has a special place in my heart but this was an intense experience for sure.",10,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer is a captivating masterpiece that skillfully combines drama, history, and humanity. With stunning cinematography, powerful performances, exceptional score and sound design, and thought-provoking storytelling, it immerses viewers in the complex world of J. Robert Oppenheimer. The film explores his personal journey, from leading the Manhattan Project to grappling with the moral implications of his scientific breakthrough. It raises profound questions about the consequences of scientific progress and serves as a reminder of the ethical dilemmas that accompany it. A must-watch for those intrigued by science, history, and the human experience.",10,Oppenheimer
"This was my most anticipated film of the year, as a fan of Nolan's previous films. After what, in my opinion, was a bit of a miss with Tenet, I was eager to see how Nolan's next film would turn out, and if it would be a return to form or a convoluted and overstuffed picture. I am very pleased to say I found Oppenheimer to be very much a return to form for Nolan, up there with his best work such as Inception, Interstellar, the Dark Knight, Memento and the Prestige. Everyone plays their parts very well, and along with a crisp, entertaining and intriguing screenplay and score, the film surges to great heights.Compared to the mind-bending enthralling dreamscapes of Inception, or the majestic and expansive reaches of space in Interstellar, Oppenheimer is focused on the much less fantastical, but no less significant, real life figures in a race to harness the power of the atom to win the Second World War. At the center of this struggle is J Robert Oppenheimer, a complex and brilliant individual whose nuance and inner turmoil is captured perfectly in a tour de force performance by Cillain Murphy, a frequent Christopher Nolan collaborator. Murphy does a brilliant job portraying Oppenheimer from his early graduate school days at Cambridge through to Gottingen and then his establishment of the quantum physics program at Berkeley, his collaborations with Ernest Lawrence, friendship with Isidor Rabi, on again off again fling with the erratic Jean Tatlock and his meeting with his future wife Kitty. The film starts in the middle of things with Oppenheimer's early studies through to his recruitment into the Manhattan project, and then his eventual success with the development of an atomic weapon that forever changed the history of the war and the world. The interspersed glimpses of the quantum realm and atoms was a nice visual accompaniment in my view. Nolan deftly cuts between the colored subjective view of Oppenheimer and the black and white perspective of his opponent, the calculating and crafty Lewis Strauss (played superbly with menace by Robert Downey).The film captures its source material well, using the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin as its basis. We see Oppenheimer reach the pinnacle of his scientific career, being on the cover of time magazine, meeting President Truman and achieving a remarkable success in developing the nuclear gadget that ended the war. He wins rightfully deserved accolades, but is haunted by the carnage, suffering and loss his creation brings about. He begins to speak out against the proliferation of nuclear weapons to avert a greater tragedy, but sadly it is too late. As they say, pride comes before the fall, and as Prometheus was punished for giving fire to humanity, so to was the American Prometheus brought low after his great triumph. We see the insidious plan of Strauss put into motion, driven by his belief that Oppenheimer poisoned other scientists against him. Part of the hearing against Oppenheimer's criticism was indeed his opposition to further nuclear proliferation and the development of even more destructive weapons. Strauss's plot leads to the discrediting and erasure of Oppenheimers credibility until he loses his security clearance and is essentially forced out of government work, his reputation in ruins.All in all, the film is an engaging and carefully crafted look into one of the most significant men in history, whose work forever changed not just the face of war, but the world itself. While he achieved tremendous personal and professional success and reached the pinnacle of his career, he was tormented by the destruction he had unleashed with his work and began to show remorse for what he had wrought. The film does a great job in laying out Oppenheimer's character, both virtues and flaws and leaving it to the viewer to judge who he was as a person.The only complaints I have with the film are that it drags a bit at the end. This is the longest of Nolan's films at a shade over three hours, and while the pacing is for the most part great, the beginning and end of the film do seem a bit quick and dragged out, respectively. The inclusion of a few sex scenes that seemed out of place and bizarre was my other gripe. These were perhaps meant to indicate Oppenheimer's vulnerability and mistakes, but I felt they were unnecessary and gratuitous. In short, I think the film was, for the most part, an excellent and compelling portrayal of one of history's most fascinating individuals.",10,Oppenheimer
"This thing has been talked about for what feels like the entire last year and it was simply... okay. The acting was good and the visuals are striking at time but the plot itself was kinda boring. They spent a bunch of time litigating his security clearance and like... honestly who cares ?? Lol. I was expecting more emphasis on the bomb itself. And sure the first two hours goes into that but the last hour dragsssss. I was expecting more dissection of the psyche of the people were affected by the bombs going off. You really only see it from one point of view - Oppenheimer's. And like okay we get it, he had major regrets about being involved. But who cares? I would've loved to see more from the victims point of view or the towns and cities affected. It was only okay and honestly expected more from a brilliant film maker like Nolan. Honestly I'm sure my opinion on the film is highly affected by the CRAZY STUPID HYPE surrounding this film. Mind you, when films have a lot of hype, I tend to temper my expectations. And I did with this one too, but even still it didn't live up to what I was expecting.If you're wondering if you should see this in theaters, I say no. You'll get just as much of the experience by watching it at home. Especially since the movie is soooo dialogue heavy and the bomb scene is super shot. Also, since this is a review with spoilers, it doesn't even show the actual bomb!!!! So stupid. Just the testing leading up to the bomb. I was here expecting some cataclysmic explosion and watching these towns get destroyed (in hindsight I know it's barbaric and I am not a sadist in the slightest, I don't even like true crime shows to the level most people do). But I just expected... more.",6,Oppenheimer
"My son just described Oppenheimer as one hour of physics, one hour of building a bomb, and one hour of courtroom drama. That it is, but he neglected to mention that it's a full 181 minutes of bum-numbing Oscar-bait that will be a test of patience for all but dedicated Nolanites (or nuclear physicists, but I don't think there were many of those at the screening I attended).I don't care how urgent and emotional the music gets, it's still people talking about quantum mechanics, communism and legal stuff that I didn't quite understand. It's not exactly a fun watch, nor a particularly profound one: we all know that the creation of atomic bombs ended WWII but ushered in an age of nuclear threat that still hangs over us today. I think most sane people would happily put the genie back in the bottle if they could. The film says nothing new - it merely emphasises how most of us feel about war, and nuclear weapons in general. Nolan could have done that in a lot less time, but the film wouldn't feel as important then, would it?The performances are undeniably good, with Murphy putting in a strong turn as the titular scientist, Nolan delivers some fairly impressive visuals (although the long awaited detonation of the test bomb is underwhelming - I doubt seeing it in IMAX would have helped), and I now know what Florence Pugh looks like naked (now that I would liked to have seen in IMAX!), but I feel that mankind needs a three hour biopic about J. Robert Oppenheimer about as much as it needs a destructive force capable of destroying the planet many times over.3/10. It's like Oliver Stone's JFK for science nerds - long, boring, and destined to win awards (they'll give an Oscar to any old tripe these days - **cough** Everything, Everywhere All At Once **cough**).",3,Oppenheimer
"This film is pure cinema. Its the perfect combination of brillant story telling and outstanding performances. Its not just about the making of bomb. Its more about the politics that played around it. Some of the shots are so brilliant that you feel like you are actually in the film and it feels like it should never end. Looking at the reviews from everyother platform, you might as well know about the performance of Cillian Murphy. No doubt its one of the best character display I have ever seen, but for me the impact which Robert Downey Junior makes, is worth a special mention. Overall the movie is a great experience and if you wish to watch it, watch it only in IMAX. You will not regret it.",10,Oppenheimer
As a fan of both Cillian and Nolan sir ..this films brings the joy of watching a super grand historic saga in the cinema halls ... Oppenheimer has made me travel 250 kms for IMAX ...as i know if i miss this i will not be able to forgive myself .. This film not only makes u at the edge of the seat knowing all the outcomes but also makes ur ears focussed on the exceptional dialogues and bg score . Not forgetting the performance given by RDJ ..he has given one of the best performances in his career ...This film is not only a treat to watch but also shows how The Great Robert Oppenheimer was cheated by his own countrie's pitty politics .. People are saying this is a long movie but watching it never made me feel about the duration of this masterpiece.... and is one of the best casting made for each and every role ...I am sure about watching it again 😍,10,Oppenheimer
"I will keep it brief.Ignore all the haters that has given lower than a 7 star review. As I read some of their reviews it seems that they haven't even seen the movie. They are either judging ""the book by it's cover"" or they are intentionally review bombing the movie. I mean let's be real, who can believe a 1-star review for a movie that has the most amazing cast and written and directed by the most prestigious filmmaker of our time.It's a masterpiece. Amazing acting, cinematography and sound design. Definitely expecting 5-6 oscar nominations.I promise you will be left shaken with your heart in your throat.It's a must watch. Watch it on iMAX in its intended format.",10,Oppenheimer
"Just walking out of the theatre after watching the double feature #Barbenheimer. The two-hour movie was awful. AWFUL! I'm so glad I got to see that one first because the three-hour movie...aka Oppenheimer...was genius. Absolutely phenomenal. I will have to see it again to clear up in my mind which guys was which scientist. Einstein (obvious, of course) was a glorious character (as he was in real life), so I thoroughly enjoyed Tom Conti's portrayal of him. I am a huge fan of Matthew Modine - what a gift to see him on the big screen again. Gary Oldman is unreal (and unrecognizable) as Truman. Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., and Downey's (Strauss') advisor (don't know who the actor is) steal the last 25 minutes of the show. Wonderful work all around!",9,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer is a mesmerizing film from start to finish. Superbly directed and cut the movie makes sense of a complicated American genius. From its visceral sound track and visuals to the tremendous acting of Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. The three hour run time flys by. The cast is a veritable who's who of great actors. Emily Blunt is also astonishing as Kitty Oppenheimer.The many contradictions in Oppenheimer's life fits so well with Nolan's directorial style. There is movement in time, but not to be distracting. The movie peaks with The Trinity test, but then has a gut wrenching final act showing the destruction of Oppenheimer at the hands of small men with petty agendas and motives. The path from the peak of triumph at building the bomb and ending the war to the depths of Oppenheimer losing his clearance is gut wrenching.I highly recommend this movie. See it in IMAX.",10,Oppenheimer
"It is a very great movie in all respects. I watched it on the imax screen. It was something dazzling throughout the 3 hours. I did not feel bored or look at the clock at all. The acting was very beautiful and also, for sure, the directing was very great. The dialogues that were present throughout the film were beautiful and had a strong meaning and presence in the story. It is not present in vain. I expect that I will watch it in the cinema more than once during this period. It is one of the most beautiful works that I have seen during the past two years and deservedly deserves the Oscar in many aspects.",10,Oppenheimer
"I have given it 8 out of 10 because it held my attention and was pretty good. But some things really annoyed me about it.Nolan has a problem with pace. Everything is unrelentingly frenetic. He seems afraid of the quiet and the slow. He doesn't do lingering shots like Tarkovsky. When characters decide to have important conversations, they walk quickly in large groups through corridors accompanied by loud intrusive music so we can't overhear them. Even when Oppy merely thinks about particles, we are assaulted by phantasmagorical images and loud unpleasant noises.The centrepiece of the film, the detonation of the first atomic bomb, is surprisingly unconvincing and underwhelming. Nolan apparently doesn't like CGI but he should have used it here. Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not depicted. A shame. I wanted to see spectacular nuclear explosions.I don't think Cillian Murphy is as good in his role as some people are saying. He can't convey the depth and breadth of Oppenheimer's intelligence. He looks good when he puts Oppenheimer's hat on but any actor would. I felt he was outshone by Robert Downey Jr. Which slightly unbalanced the film in my view. This film should have at its heart the question of the morality of nuclear weapons. But Downey Jr is so good he makes it seem like the film is all about the petty grudges of a long-forgotten politician.Tom Conti is preposterous as Albert Einstein. Conti always thinks that if he chuckles away to himself, we will be fooled into thinking he's a great actor.And Nolan's non-linear narrative habit seems incurable now.",8,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer was by far the movie I looked forward to the most this year. To see a Christopher Nolan film is to know that you are going to find a story that plays with its timelines, with deep and complex characters and a dense environment, among other things. Well, this time, Nolan lives up to his standards and delivers us a full-blown movie. However, as much as I hate to see a movie with expectations, whether good or bad, it seems to me that despite all the hype surrounding Oppenheimer, the movie falls short in some key elements.But first, let's highlight the good. The screenplay should always be the highlight in these films, but in this case so is the cinematography, sound editing, and soundtrack. Elements that greatly increase the quality of a film if they are well used from a new perspective for the cinema itself.The performances are very good, by experienced and recognized actors, although Nolan's supervising hand is also evident.The production design couldn't be bad for the film's budget, but let's also not forget the excellent practical effects used for the explosions and other details. Cinema made in the old school, with a renewed and modern vision, like that of the master Nolan.Now... let's get into what I didn't like.Starting with the big elephant in the room. The fashionable elephant in today's cinema. Why does it take 3 hours of film to show a biopic that could have been a 2 hour film? I had to say it.Now, the deeper problem is not that. The film shows a clear 3-part structure. A clearly divided story that, despite the fact that it's constantly interconnected with its time lines, wants to play at being a conventional movie, but it can't. This can be good and bad at the same time. Its climax is located at a rather weird point and the third act doesn't really feel like it. In the end it turns into an endless drama, with characters that stop being interesting, in an outcome that, although it is not predictable, is quite flat and boring.Finally, the last negative point would be the lack of scenes that prove the ""success"" of the bomb, which explodes only in the mind of the protagonist in a very interesting way, considering that in many points we're seeing the story from inside the mind from Oppenheimer himself.To close, this work is unmissable, it'll be widely remembered, and technically it's pure gold, but it isn't one of the films that I'd see again.",8,Oppenheimer
"I'm a scientist and an engineer, with a healthy respect for history. Surely there could be hardly any fewer more important topics than this movie.But I guess their attempt to show respect to the dead and through the topic seriously, which to be fair is warranted, leads to a truly bleak film.Bleakness, despair, tension is supposed to build and relax, build and relax, you can't just hold it at maximum value for 3 hours.And there's just a mountain of exposition. Hey, I get it, real life is complicated, so if you want to remain true it's hard to make a single theme that wraps up neatly. But this film takes it too far. It includes essentially every single person, and there is far too much emphasis on courtroom drama instead of the scientists. At times, it relies on the audience to be preloaded with all and respect for the events, instead of earning that. The story is just too complicated, unable to go into depth with anything in a headlong rush of minor characters and historical facts.This is really a five-star movie to me. I walked out close to the end when I realized that the film still wasn't close to ending. But it's important topic, so I'll give six stars.",6,Oppenheimer
"I disagree with what others have said about the technical aspects of the film. I thought the cinematography was so-so and the sound and musical score were awful. There were many times I had to read lips because some annoying background music or rumbling sound or just plain noise grew so loud that the dialog could not be heard. It wasn't even there to evoke emotions like anticipation or fear; it was just noise. And visually, how hard do you need to try to screw up the film of a nuclear explosion? It kind of looked like an overloaded barbecue grill it was so bad.Content wise, I just couldn't get invested in the story or the characters. The director and screenwriter need to go the extra mile to tell a story that the viewers already know, but slicing that story into a million cuts isn't the way to go. While I agree with other reviews that say the storytelling is too nonlinear and requires too much attention for three hours, that, per se, wouldn't have bothered me if I had been engrossed in the story, but I never reached the level of investment where the three hours would slip by quickly. I partially blame bad editing. It was almost as if my mind wanted to live through the movie in a dream-like state, but the editor kept waking me up every minute or so. I ended up checking my watch a few times.",5,Oppenheimer
"Writing this right after leaving the theater, I am absolutely awestruck at the masterpiece I just witnessed. A brilliant and fast paced movie throughout, this movie truly showcases just how good of a writer Nolan is. No other Nolan movie features this much dialogue and reminded me that Nolan's writing is often overshadowed by his directing skills. That being said, I do believe this film features his greatest directing ever. The acting was superb as Cillian Murphy turns in his best performance yet and was able to shine in nearly every scene of this 3 hour epic. The whole supporting cast was great with wonderful cameos all throughout, but I believe Robert Downey Jr. Deserves praise especially. The score perfectly encapsulates the intense nature of the film and even the sound mixing was spot on as my theater was genuinely shaking. The cinematography even rivals that of other impressive Nolan pictures such as Interstellar. This movie was very dense despite being 3 hours long and was truly the fastest 3 hours has ever felt as I still wanted more. This movie is thrilling throughout and will never leave you bored. Being a Nolan film, expect timelines to jump from one point to the next, but I think the way this was edited is truly his best work. I want to take more time to determine where this will fall on my rankings of Nolan's movies but already I know it's top 3. Any Nolan fan knows that being in the top 3 for this list means it is brilliant given the stiff competition. To see this film, myself and a few other Nolan fans were incredibly hyped for this movie for over a year and even drove an hour and a half away to see this movie on an IMAX screen. I now understand why it was so important to witness this spectacle as such because I have never felt more immersed in a movie before. Without a doubt a masterpiece and a perfect 10/10, do yourself a favor and find the biggest screen possible and let yourself be blown away from start to finish. This is Nolan at his finest.",10,Oppenheimer
"""Openheimer"" is an ambitious and intellectually stimulating cinematic masterpiece that delves into the life of one of the most enigmatic and controversial figures of the 20th century - J.

It serves as a reminder of the importance of understanding history's dark secrets and the consequences of our actions, urging us to reflect on the legacy we leave behind.",10,Oppenheimer
"Christopher Nolan has delivered yet another cinematic masterpiece with this dark, poignant and powerful biopic of deeply flawed yet brilliant mind. Using Kai Bird's book ""American Prometheus"" as a platform, Nolan leaves the audience contemplating Robert's motivation as an American icon or Anti hero.As J. Robert Oppenheimer and his contemporaries are questioned in relation to his loyalty to his country and Soviet communist ties, we are transported to the turmoil of the professional and private life of Oppenheimer and the mind that would change the world.There are standout performances everywhere, most notably Robert Downey Jnr and of course Cillian Murphy, who could be knocking the door on an oscar nod. Using no CGI also adds to the films authenticity. This is just one of those cinematic moments despite it's length, is simply brilliant.",10,Oppenheimer
"Nolan's newest film is both well-acted and well shot. I believe those are the movie's best aspects so I'll get to why I don't think it stands out among his best films. Though there is nothing wrong with dialogue carrying the plot, film is still meant to be a visual medium. When I found out that this film was based on a book, ""American Prometheus"", I was not shocked. This film just went too far with the dialogue and I feel like they didn't have to add every element from the novel into this movie. It just made it too long and too hard to follow. Again, well-acted with a fantastic cast and the social and political commentary was brilliant, but I felt it went too far with the back-and-forth between characters.",8,Oppenheimer
"POSITIVES:1) Cillian Murphy is absolutely spellbinding. He carries the whole film on his back and plays Oppenheimer during so many different parts of his life, yet he never for a second seems to falter in any way. He should be guaranteed a Best Actor nomination. I also think Robert Downey Jr should be guaranteed a Best Supporting Actor nomination
2) This almost goes without saying for Nolan, but the film has been made unbelievably well. It looks like a painting during so many sequences and I loved the way in which the changing of timeframes and the changing of colour was used
3) The score and the sound design were both incredible. Incredible. The score had me feeling so engaged and literally gripping my seat, whilst the sound design of the explosions made me feel like the cinema was going to take off
4) The moral / philosophical questions at the heart of the film are really thought provoking. I also think this is helped by the fact that none of the characters are perfect, they're all very flawed which makes them all incredibly interestingNEGATIVES:1) There are too many side characters, most of whom aren't really given any backstory or time to shine, so it ends up being very difficult to remember exactly who is who
2) There is a scene near the end where it shows all the characters in their old age, and I thought the old age makeup looked bad and it took me out of the scene.",9,Oppenheimer
"""Wow"" - My exact sentiment as soon as the credits rolled. Nolan is truly a master film maker, this movie truly was an experience to be had only in the cinema.Oppenheimer really is a biopic, and anyone expecting a war movie or some kind of action packed film is sorely mistaken. This is an insight into the incredible mind of a man tasked with a truly ardous dilemma or life and death.It's easy on the eyes, food for thought and no doubt will be hailed as a timeless classic. Cillian is so brilliant in this role, I couldn't praise him any higher, he deserves an award for this portrayal, easily.For a 3 hour long movie, it was fast paced and at no point was I bored.",10,Oppenheimer
"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.Perfect experience.",10,Oppenheimer
"(9.7) A near perfect film and easily one of the best films I've ever seen. The cast is amazing and each actor performs like they never have before, particularly Murphy and Downey. The tone of the film transforms with the plot throughtout and the movie is plauged with themes of guilt that are expertly shown through Nolan's Directing and Cillian's acting. Towards the second half of the film the directing almost has a kind of aspect of horror. The film might be 3 hours but it does not drag at all and it leaves you wanting more by the end. The best scene is the scene containing the detonation of the atomic bomb.",10,Oppenheimer
"Obviously, this is a massive undertaking, not as much as building the bomb but to juggle all these characters and motivations and make it coherent is overwhelming. That said, this needed some serious, serious cutting. Nolan gives way too much time to the loss of Oppenheimer's security clearance at the end. It does not carry the same weight as the mental and emotional struggle to build the bomb. Nolan beats us senseless in the last third by having these long, boring sessions where Oppenheimer and his witness are verbally assaulted during his security hearing. Who cares? 226,000 people were killed by the bomb and the scenes afterwards have to do with his security clearance and accusations of communist sympathies? Yeah, ok, that's important to Oppenheimer but I was praying for it to end quickly. Nolan went off the rails at the end. That last third was just ok. Could have cut a lot of repetitive information that just doesn't mean squat.",6,Oppenheimer
"Contrary to most other Nolan films, this one I do not see myself watching again. This story about physicists and politicians is just not interesting. The story of the atomic bomb deserved better, by dealing with the bombs and their aftermath instead of some historically obscure character's confirmation hearing, and the grilling Oppenheimer received in the closed-door hearing. The film has no soul, does not resound emotionally. There were no build ups, everything just happened. I didn't learn anything I already knew from Youtube videos when preparing to watch the film (certainly nothing about quantum mechanics or the bomb) since I was told about the challenge of following the story, which I hence had no problem following, particularly about the life of Oppenheimer. In the film he is suddenly an acclaimed physicist, then suddenly a leading candidate to lead the Manhattan project, and so on. Poor Cillian Murphy was just there, I didn't feel anything nor cared about the character, his genius and alleged depravity, his guilty conscience. His wife been mad at him for not fighting back ironically applies to the actor's performance in the film. The guy was apparently as boring in real life as in the film. There was nothing technically outstanding and have no idea why I needed to watch the film in IMAX nor the reason for the black and white scenes.",1,Oppenheimer
"If you're going in expecting an action heavy film filled with explosions, then this probably isnt for you. The film is centered around a trial against Oppenheimer and is mostly told through flashbacks. One through the biased POV of Strauss (Robert Downey Jr) and through Oppenheimer himself (Cillian Murphy). The film is long - and also feels very long. So you definitely have to be in the right mindset to sit down and watch. But I really enjoyed watching this exploration of this man and his psyche. The film poses a lot of questions about whether one should have this power. And it actually made me want to read a biography about him.There was headlines before the film came out about the sex scenes. Florence is topless but otherwise nothing else is explicitly shown. There is one scene where they are both sitting naked across from each other that felt unnecessary, mainly as it just felt random, that they could have cut out. But otherwise, kind of tame. I don't know why it was hyped up as much it was.The film also has a ton of cameos. Almost to the point where it becomes a bit distracting. And not all of them are necessary. Does Jack Quaid really do anything in this movie for instance? But none of them are bad. Definitely Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr and Emily Blunt are the highlights of the film though and would also be deserving of Oscar nominations.One of the best films of the year.",9,Oppenheimer
"This is, by far, the most important film of the 21st century. It should win every category. This film is not about the bomb per say. It is about F. Robert Oppenheimer and his grave sin.*Spoilers ahead, skip to end* -I went into this movie expecting a race towards the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the way it affected the world around us, and the effect it had on Roberts life. What I did not expect was a full deep dive into the life of Oppenheimer and the thrilling ladder half of this film. You can physically feel the emotion that is conveyed in Cillian's Oscar-worthy performance. There was not a scene that I felt deeply connected to the protagonist and his efforts, including his unbearable shame and regret. The supporting cast does an outstanding job as well. Most of the supporting cast are capable of a lead role themselves, let alone absolutely killing their 20 minutes screen time in this 3 hour long spectacle. Allegedly, RDJ believed his role as 'Iron Man' would stunt this performance, as he would behave more like Tony Stark. I did not even recognize him until the 1.5 hour mark when his character became agitated. His performance was immaculate. The ending is not necessarily happy, as it ends with a conversation the audience was aware of but did not ever hear. This spine chilling conversation ended with Oppenheimer staring into a pond with grim, thrilling music with a very slow zoom in on Roberts face. The entire movie is a work of art, and the ending left me uneasy, yet satisfied.*End of spoilers*10/10. Christopher Nolan once again proving he is one of the greatest directors of all time. Best movie I have seen in years.",10,Oppenheimer
"Mr Nolan at his best. Just WoW.Performance of Cillian Murphy & Robert Downey JR is just outstanding.The conflict of Oppenheimer's Life as shown is completely apt for such an important person, May be the most important person of that time...
The visuals of TRINITY TEST just blown me away... the work of NOLAN there just shows why as a director he'll be remembered for all along the time...
Overall a masterpiece.. completely satisfied ..
The dialogue ' I AM BECOME THE DEATH, THE DESTROYER OF THE WORLD ' just shows the POV of Oppenheimer himself... What he thought about it was clearly shown in the film.. loved it completely....",10,Oppenheimer
"Fantastic acting from top to bottom from a really good cast (Robert Downey Jr is all but unrecognizable, really great to see him lose himself in a role again). It's a compelling story. I can't claim to know anything about Robert Oppenheimer besides the history headlines, but it appears he was much more complex than the headlines would indicate. My only real complaint about this film is the score. I tend to love the scores of no Nolan's films, but this one is overbearing. It's too loud and intrudes on too many scenes. It's nearly constant, and that winds up detracting from the impact of some of the scenes, which, given how dramatic the score is, is exactly the opposite of what's intended. I found it pretty distracting, and a significant miscalculation. Nonetheless, this is one of those movies that everyone really ought to see. Side note about the story. I didn't really go into this knowing what to expect, but a significant part of the story and the plot center on the politics around the Manhattan Project during and after. This aspect of the movie for me was the most compelling part of it, in addition to oppenheimer's own grappling with the magnitude of what he had contributed to.",8,Oppenheimer
"This movie is the most intense movie i have seen in a theatre. The whole 3 hours felt so intense. Even the interrogation scenes were near perfect dialogues. I didn't felt a single scene was forced or amateurish. Coming to acting, Cilian Murphy delivers his career best performance, and Matt Damon was extraordinary and Robert Downey might have given his best acting till date. Even without a single fight scenes, Nolan has made this more interesting than most of superhero movies. I think the dialogues deserve extra credit. Reminds me of watching 'The godfather' movie which had perfect dialogues. Definitely this one tops Dunkirk and Tenet, but I can't really compare this with Interstellar, prestige and inception, because of difference in genre.The best movie in last few years!Cinematography-10/10
Background score-10/10
Acting-9.8/10
Length-8/10.",10,Oppenheimer
"Before going to see Oppenheimer I would strongly advise looking up some background information on Oppenheimer's life beforehand. This film is not interested in hand holding or dumbing information down, nor is it interested in relaxing its pace so that those without at least some prior knowledge of the subject can catch up. This film moves at a cracking pace, effortlessly blending different time lines and events in a brilliantly crafted story that contains some of the best acting I've seen since Sir Anthony Hopkins took home the Oscar for The Father. Cillian Murphy is almost transcendental as J Robert Oppenheimer, so far does her disappear into the character. The rest of the cast is entirely on point as well, the cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking at points, and the soundscape is incredible. I kept waiting for the point where I'd feel as if I was watching a 3 hour film, and it never came, that is how engaged I felt with this movie.10/10 without hesitation. What a fantastic cinema experience this was.(Viewed in 70mm film print with DTS sound)",10,Oppenheimer
"Usually, the films of Christopher Nolan traffic in mind-bending (often time-bending) science fiction or fantasy. ""Oppenheimer"" is a clear departure from that type of movie, but proves to be just as landmark of an achievement in biopics provided one views it as such.For a very basic overview, Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" tells the story of the famed quantum physicist Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) who would go on to create the first atomic weapon. While his work at Los Alamos certainly comprises large swaths of this picture, Oppenheimer is also examined as a young free-thinker (maybe ""Communist""?) as well as his post-WWII scrutiny when his views on atomic warfare changed radically (away from hawk and towards dove).The biggest consideration one must make in evaluating ""Oppenheimer"" is simply to understand that it is a true biopic. This isn't the story of the Manhattan Project, nor is it a World War 2-centric tale. The film's title is an accurate representation of the subject matter, to be sure. Viewed through this prism, the film's final act (which has been the sticking point for some viewers) plays a lot better.Besides clearly capturing the Oppenheimer persona and visage, the hallmark of Nolan's work here is examining the shades of gray in that monumental figure's life. Viewers who want to definitively see Oppenheimer as ""one thing or the other"" will be challenged, as this biopic revels in the ""middle ground"", so to speak. How can a man support Communist/Fascist causes and create the most destructive weapon of all-time for a capitalist government? How can a man be so brilliant in scientific principles but also so naive when it comes to basic life assumptions? How can the creator of such destruction turn away from nuclear proliferation and towards arms treaties? Finally, how can a government so thoroughly use a man of such prodigious talent and then immediately smear him when his values don't line up with ""the state"" any longer? Not only are these complex issues compelling through Nolan's specific Oppenheimer lens, but they ring as true today as they ever did in that man's life and times.Of course, ""Oppenheimer"" doesn't lack any of the Nolan panache. It is expertly shot by Hoyte van Hoytema, the score (Ludwig Goransson) is pulse-pounding yet subtle when needed, and Murphy is riveting as the lead. Being surrounded by the likes of Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Josh Hartnett, and Florence Pugh (plus an endgame cameo from a Nolan film acolyte) doesn't hurt, either.I'm almost a week out from seeing ""Oppenheimer"" and I'm still digesting exactly what I saw. I've settled on 9/10 stars for now, but feel that once I read the book it is based on and watch it again it may reach 10/10 status.So, by all means come for the ""big boom"" and the super-secret weapons project stuff--that's all edge-of-your-seat compelling. But also realize that Oppenheimer the man/figure is the true focus of Nolan's creative vision here--not superheroes, time-travelers, magicians, or dreamscapes. Armed with that understanding, ""Oppenheimer"" stands out nearly as much as those other works in its own unique way.",9,Oppenheimer
"""Oppenheimer"" is a magnum opus that showcases Christopher Nolan's brilliance as a filmmaker. Spanning four decades of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life, the film masterfully weaves a scrambled chronology, captivating audiences with its absorbing narrative. Cillian Murphy delivers a mesmerizing performance, embodying Oppenheimer's complex and enigmatic persona. Nolan's monumentalist approach immerses us in the grandeur of the story, exploring the moral implications of Oppenheimer's work and the era's social complexities. The movie's visuals are a symphony of artistry, magnificently capturing the essence of the Los Alamos years and Strauss' sequences. With a stellar supporting cast, ""Oppenheimer"" ignites essential discussions that remain relevant today. Nolan's cinematic brilliance elevates ""Oppenheimer"" to a profound and timeless work of art, leaving a lasting impact on its audiences.",10,Oppenheimer
"Rating: 6.9I thought this was going to be better than what it was. It was a finely crafted movie, the presentation was phenomenal, the message was potent and Cillian Murphy carries as Oppenheimer, but I found some of the intricacies a little hard to follow and unfortunately boring. A lot of the dialogue especially in the second act was just laying out the bureaucracy of building a bomb which isn't entertaining; security clearances, compartmentalization, acquiring personnel, etc. There are a lot of characters in this movie many aren't on screen long enough for me to fully understand their role in the narrative which leads to confusion for those who aren't history buffs. If you know the history this movie will probably fare better, but the real highlight was the visual imagery that conveys Oppenheimer's mental state, and the detonation itself. I'm not sure why in the beginning Oppenheimer was having nightmares and visions of quantum physics (at that point he hadn't built the bomb yet and shouldn't be suffering from any PTSD), but I might've missed something. As a whole an quickly paced slightly boring watch.",6,Oppenheimer
"There was only 2 moments i can remember after watching the whole movie. When the 1st atomic bomb is tested and the whole movie goes quite and you only hear the small noises, no dialogue nothing then the shockwave hits and my god it sounded amazing i was so happy when that happened and mind you if happened after 30 minutes of slow pacing boring starting. I couldn't focus on the movie what so ever cause the story telling was so random that sometimes it shows the current event, goes back to the past, goes even past when oppenhimer was young lad in collage. I was just left confused. I wanted to walk out during the whole movie. Sorry but cillian murphy was the only good thing about the movie.",2,Oppenheimer
"Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest directors working today. Whenever his name is attached to a film, it always brings people to cinemas. I was a bit apprehensive at first with Oppenheimer since Tenet was underwhelming and since it was a biopic, something you would think Nolan wouldn't do. Yet he did and he pulled it off in spectacular fashion.Oppenheimer is a powerful exploration of the father of the atomic bomb, exploring his life, his work and how he viewed the world. This is all brought life by a powerful script and break neck pacing that keeps you engaged all the way to the end. This film was the shortest three hours of my life.The cinematography is outstanding, constantly immersing the audience into Oppenheimer's mind and is complimented by a sublime soundtrack. The sound design is also immaculate and the attention to detail in the physics is excellent. The visuals are outstanding and it amazes me that it was all practical which makes it all the more impressive. All these aspects combine to make a bleak, doomsday-like movie which asks multiple moral questions of the audience but also allows the audience to interpret it in their own way.But the greatest aspect of this film is the performances. Cilian Murphy is absolutely excellent as Oppenheimer, expertly portraying a confident and charismatic scientist eventually becoming a disillusioned and guilt-ridden figure. He is the centre-piece of this film and deserves all the praise. The supporting cast is stacked but a particular mention must go to Robert Downey Jr who delivers a brilliant performance as Lewis Strauss, arguably the strongest of his career. All the cast give it their all.In conclusion, Oppenheimer stands as one of Nolan's best works and arguably his best film since Inception. It is thrilling, poignant and expertly made. A must-watch for all and one I look forward to re-watching countless times.",9,Oppenheimer
"This movie had made me wonder so much more about Robert J Oppenheimer, what a man he was! This movie was just a masterpiece directed by a legend Christopher Nolan.The annoying part about seeing this movie was, there was a guy, deliberately snoring a few times right next to me, and his phone was on sound as well, which was a nuisance.Still I loved this movie, the acting from the main lead actor, Cillian Murphy had put me a smile in my face, but I won't forget Robert Downey Jr's astounding performance too. Still this movie is so interesting and terrifying because this is based on the father of the atomic bomb. Even though it was too long, I would still would love to rewatch it again. Some scenes were unnecessary but this movie still tops as one of the greatest movies of the 2023.Hoping for Cillian Murphy to win his first Oscar Award!",10,Oppenheimer
"I still vividly remember watching ""Interstellar"" for the first time when I was 10 years old. I was captivated, not necessarily by the story - which I didn't fully understand at the time - but by the manner in which it was portrayed, and by the depth of emotion conveyed by the actors. My experience with ""Oppenheimer"" was similar. Although the movie initially captivated me, I found myself lost for about ten minutes due to my difficulties with English as a second language. However, the remainder of the film had me utterly mesmerized. I would definitely recommend giving it a shot; Nolan never disappoints.",10,Oppenheimer
"I don't even know where to begin.Not every director can bring out the best in a star-studded cast, but that's definitely not the case with Nolan.It's a true pleasure to be alive and witness his work, along with Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and many others giving their best.The film's cinematography is one of the best I've ever seen, from the set design to the screenplay, sound, and costumes; everything borders on perfection in the most literal sense.Few movies bring to the senses, even to those less familiar with the art of cinematography, such distinct aspects of audiovisual elements.The only negative aspect is that at some point, the movie ends.Can't wait to watch It more times.",10,Oppenheimer
"In his twelve film Chris Nolan brings us a character study into onde of the most important and controversial decisions ever made in the history of manquind, the making and decision to use the Nuclear Bomb and we get to see this by the perspective of the man who was in charge of The Manhattan Project Mr J Robert Oppenheimer.Regarding most of his filmography this is a first for Nolan because its character driven and more about the decision to make or dont make The Bomb and once made, to use it or don't use it and after that if we as a society should ever do it again. It's a grey area that we find our main character and the aftermath of the decisions made by these historycal characters is what shapes The 21st century for better or worstJust because we can doesnt mean we should?The film makes us all wonder about the ambiguity of what was done to end the most deadly conflict in human history and the ramifications on the person who was in charge of doing the Impossible, harvesting the power of God and use It for catastrophic destruction.The sound, edit,writing and general performances are the best of the best so expect alot from the cast and crew during the awards season.Its not the most spectacural of the Nolan films ( but with films as Inception and Interstelar who whould have done better) but is the most down to earth character driven and ambigous take of his filmography wich will leave you with hours of topics to think and discuss after watching the film!",8,Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer had quite possibly the best cinematography of any movie I have ever seen. The visuals were outstanding. I was mesmerized as I watched every scene. This movie was filmed entirely in IMAX and the film stretched multiple miles long. The black and white scenes were also filmed in 70mm Black & White, which has never been used before. This is just the cherry on top of the cinematography.The score in this movie was wonderful as well. The background music kept the movie intense, and even scary in some scenes. The impact that the sound effects made in the theater was incredible, it made the movie that much better. Absolutely wonderful!I don't think I need to get into the acting-but I will. The cast of this movie is as stacked as much as any movie i've ever seen. Cillian Murphy provides a performance of the century, which leads this movie in its success. RDJ also delivers an immaculate performance as the supporting actor, and it is possibly his best performance ever. These two will both be nominated for oscar's this upcoming year. The rest of the cast each had their own role to play and have ZERO complaints with any of them, they all did a wonderful job, 10/10 Acting in this movie.Christopher Nolan did an incredible job depicting the real story and turning into a movie. The movie stays relatively accurate with the actually history of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Nolan chose a piece of history that is not only important to him, but is possibly the most important piece of history ever.This movie will impact cinema in a big way. It has multiple lines that will remembered for a long time. Oppenheimer could single-handedly bring back the popularity of biopic films. This movie was highly anticipated and rightfully so. This is Nolan's best work in my opinion, and that is saying a lot considering he is one of the best directors of our time. I, personally, am thankful to be alive to witness Nolan's work, and especially to witness this cinematic masterpiece of a film.Thank You, Christopher Nolan.",10,Oppenheimer
"I watched this movie both in English and Hindi languages,and no doubt this could become one of the highest grossing R rated movies.Positives of the movie is Christopher Nolan's screenplay,direction, performances of the lead cast and soundtrack. These type of movies would easily become slow paced and dull,what makes this movie interesting is fast paced editing, brilliantly crafted non linear story telling.It's true that this movie is not for everyone, but everyone is on for watching it. Oppenheimer is a masterpiece that blends emotions,drama, suspense and horror. CLIMAX of this movie hits harder than a cricket ball!!!",10,Oppenheimer
"This is my most anticipated film of 2023 for a single reason and that reason is Christopher Nolan. He is easily my favorite director and when I saw the first trailer for this film I was stunned. I have not seen many new releases this year but from what I have seen this film is the best by far and when Oscar season rolls around this is going to win everything.Christopher Nolan direction is phenomenal and that fact that he said he used zero CGI is a monumental achievement. The visuals in this film are phenomenal and they need to be seen on the biggest screen you can find to thoroughly understand how great they are.This is the best all around cast I have seen in a while. Every single person brought they're A game and I could see multiple people picking up nominations and possibly a couple of wins. Cillian Murphy, oh my god, if this guy doesn't win best actor I will be shocked. This in my opinion is his best performance and possibly the best performance of the decade so far. But he is not the only stud in this film Robert Downey Jr. Was phenomenal as well, and could very easily get a win for best supporting actor. The rest of the cast was incredible, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and more all do amazing jobs.The story is emotional, impactful, and extremely well executed. The score is beyond phenomenal. Everything in this film screams give me an award, and I cannot wait for this to receive the praise it deserves.A+",10,Oppenheimer
"J. Robert Oppenheimer is a very interesting figure in the history. Therefore, the buzz around this movie is understandable considering one of the biggest director in Hollywood is making the his biographic movie. Nolan is exceptionally talented but he fell in the delusion that his fanbase created. He is really talented behind the camera. The cinematography is amazing. He has a unique eye for crating scenes and framing.His last movies though, are not as impressive as the hype his fans are creatied. This movie is not different than the his averages movies that he started to ake since Dunkirk. His storytelling was phenomenal in Memento, then Prestige, Dark Knight and Inception brought him the fame he well deserved. Yet, the editing which contains so many flashbacks, parallel stories, jump-cuts got too much in his mind and he started to use same recipe in his every movies. Oppenheimer is not an exception. This makes very difficult to follow the stories. I know his fans like the complicated storytelling and are proud of getting it, but this is not the case here. Director misses each stories when he forgets to focus the main one. Really, which story line is the main one here? There are so many stories such as building Los Alamos, creating his team, developing the atomic bomb, the hearing, the life with the women, his controversial past, his relation with scientific community. All make a big dull soup here and we end up with few resolution. When skipping the rule of focusing on one story he jumbles everything and creating a mess. A mess that difficult to follow, which I believe intentional.He needs to go back his routes or started to work with Jonathan again.",6,Oppenheimer
"Half of the movie is spent as a courtroom drama and the irony is when the guy at end says to Lewis Strauss that Oppenheimer and Einstein were discussing something more important and the movie itself is focused on Strauss's revenge instead of something more important. The editing made it more difficult to understand than it actually is. Nolan expects us to understand the plot while cutting back to back people talking. Nolan didn't bother with showing the analogy between Arjuna's inaction before war with that of Oppenheimer building a nuke. Nolan completely neglected the importance of Bhagavad Gita even worse is the disrespect. One of the most famous clip of Oppenheimer is where he recites a cryptic line justifying his actions and people would expect to learn more of it but nope. He also didn't the bother with the victims of the bomb. Credit where credit's due, the technical aspects of showing the atomic level visuals is impressive. Overall I would say this movie is a wasted opportunity.""In battle, in forest, at the precipice of the mountainsOn the dark great sea, in the midst of javelins and arrows,In sleep, in confusion, in the depths of shame,The good deeds a man has done before defend him.""Another inspiring quote by Oppenheimer which was not in the movie.",3,Oppenheimer
"Well paced and deftly edited, ""Oppenheimer"" is a suspenseful drama on the legendary physicist's creation of the atom bomb and its world-shattering implications. Cillian Murphy portrays a wide-eyed eccentric Oppenheimer who juggles the challenges of his personal and professional life where his political affiliations clash with the patriotic nature of his work leading to his later troubles with the law. An all star cast including Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, Gary Oldman, Kenneth Branagh and Rami Malek round up an impressive work. With its unflinching look at war, politics and arms ""Oppenheimer"" raises the issues on the thin line between pragmatism and morality. One of the best films of the year, this is a must see.",9,Oppenheimer
"Nolan delivers on every aspect of this movie. From a technical standpoint to the set pieces and costume designs, everything is nothing less than spectacular.With that being said I couldn't say enough for the story since if you aren't paying your full atention you can get lost and it will seem very boring. This is by no means calling the story bad, but it doesn't quite resolve some issues like what ever happened with his brother. Another minor thing but the score sometimes fw the voices of the characters and sometimes you cant really hear. Unfortunately, you do feel the 3 hour run time for about 2/3 of the entire movie.Now for the obvious stuff... the cast was all frikin amazing. Everyone says Robert D Jr was the best performance in this movie but I would argue that Emily Blunts performance during that court shocked me and my entire theater. Cillian Murphy was literally born to play this role. Frikin phenomenal. AND THE BOMB SCENE. Dont even get me started. Overall pretty good movie first watch but I can see this not being for everyone.As regards to Nolan, I have yet to see many if his movies but from what i have seen, its not even top 3 maybe 4.",8,Oppenheimer
"Nice powerful drama for 180 minutes
You don't feel boredAfter the act one the successful mission of test, beings the second act of spinning a web of deceit around Oppie, and the tables turn and how is the rest.Tone of movie is like a strict docudrama, with a exciting soundtrack as aural sweet companion.All actors were top class excelling in their craftDirection is top notchDialogues are you only ally to get by the story so pay close attentionYou always hear some big names thrown in which was nice doffing the hat for those pathbreaking physicists of that time.Will it appeal to a wider audience, I think no, as is no action or comic sequences in this epicBut for people who are interested in history, politics, physics of that time. This movie will be a milestoneMy rating is 10 on 10.. see it in a theatre with reputed sound system as it will elevate your experience.",10,Oppenheimer
"First of all if you have a true IMAX cinema near you i would recommend that you go see this movie in that theatre.Oppenheimer is a movie about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the American physicist who played a significant role in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II, it has the potential to be a compelling historical drama. The story of Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project is a fascinating and complex one, filled with ethical dilemmas, scientific discoveries, and the implications of nuclear weapons.Cillian Murphy and RDJ were absolutely amazing in this movie and their acting blow me away.For anyone who was hesitant about going to see this movie i would recommend that you see it right away.",10,Oppenheimer
"This movie was so interesting and engaging to watch and you don't know how 3 hours went. The story, the depiction of events, the performances by the cast members, the direction, the screenplay, the BGM, the pacing; everything were great. You can't find a single error in this movie except visuals but you don't need those type of visuals in this type of movie. Christopher Nolan did it, he has shown us that he can make any type of movie either it be sci-fiction or historical drama.Overall, I will definitely recommend this movie to everyone. It's so engaging and intense that you will definitely love it.",10,Oppenheimer
"In recent years, usually when a film has such a packed cast it often never met expectations so I didn't have many for this, I was confident it was gonna be good but refrained from gauging how good it could actually be. Quoting Greek mythology really set the tone for the rest of the movie. Christopher Nolan is known for blending some sci-fi to his more renowned movies; this is a history biopic but has a lot of elements resembling sci-fi. Building something that at the time period, could only be a pigment of one's imagination. The movie blends together mythology, physics, betrayal, history, philosophy, politics and moral conundrums... maybe this is recency bias but I think this is one of Christopher Nolan's best work.It doesn't climax how I expected it, and in the end, even though the movie heavily involves the Word War and is heavily influenced by war drama, more so US's bombing of Japan, the bomb itself isn't the main focus of the story, although I felt that the movie was leading us there for the first half. There's a lot more to the story and that can be seen as there's still a good chunk of runtime left after the bombing. Everything before that moment, which was a lot, seemed like it was there to help understand Oppenheimer more and the moral dilemmas he faced and how it changed him. I really lost track of time, but before what I think is the last hour of the movie, I thought the movie was about Oppenheimer's bomb, but by the end of the movie you go back to remembering it's a biopic on Oppenheimer himself. An excellent one at that, that almost out any other biopic to shame in my recent memory.The story is told from Oppenheimer perspective, well the colored scenes not the black and white ones which were impartial. We get to see him plagued by guilt and internal turmoil he faced about his betrayal; which was a reoccurring theme throughout the movie, not just to/from Oppenheimer but so many in the film. Mostly about dealing with the consequences of his success, as he's haunted by visions of an apocalypse he helped orchestrate. He started out lost in his youth, but lively at the start of his teaching and Manhattan project, but goes to a dark place after failing to justify his achievement wit the bomb, the nazi threat.The acting was superb all around, and while cillian Murphy stood out, the rest of the star studded cast performances are noticeable. All the main characters had enough screen time to not be overshadowed. Tom Conti was a standout as he used his very limited time as Albert Einstein to great use; I also loved that his and Oppenheimer's story arcs had similar endings. Robert Downey Jnr also does a splendid job, his role takes a turn, somewhat shocking as the movie mainly revolves around the manhattan's projects A-bomb creation that we don't get huge insight into his and Oppenheimer's relationship, only glimpses that you only put together at the end. Casey's Affleck's role was so secretive, he didn't have as much of a pivotal role as a I expected. Emily blunt and Florence Pugh were splendid every scene they were in. I couldn't shake that Emily Blunt's role reminded me of her in The English though, as they were set in similar surroundings. Matt Damon was also good here. Cillian Murphy has had spectacular roles in the past, most notably as Thomas Shelby of which I didn't think he could outdo, but this is probably his career defining performance to date. The cast depth is insane.There are a lot of dark themes explored in depth, so it's a little shocking we don't get to see much of Japan, it's almost glossed over once it's done. But that could be due to us watching from Oppenheimer's standpoint and how he experienced these events. The countdown was epic and suspenseful even though you know knew it was coming. It might be a story you already know from history but Nolan and his cast managed to a create a wonderful character study that submerged you into his story.The music score was great too, helping convey the emotions each scene demanded. I was also surprised by how serene the movie was, while still keeping the thrill of a war drama. How tense and calm the aura of the film was even with a bomb going off.In the end I think it's a perfect biopic, a cinematic masterpiece were we got to see all sides of Oppenheimer, however conflicting and the cast and Nolan did an amazing job depicting his life. It's a perfect movie; the cinematography, the cast, the writing, the score... what else could you ask for.",10,Oppenheimer
"Watched this film in 15/70 IMAX which is the way the film is suppose to be watched. Did it make a difference? Sort of. It is immersive. But that could be a testament to its editing. It's fast paced for a story that seems to be slow paced.Though the story of Oppenheimer has been done in the past, this one first stages the story as a brilliant scientist, recruited by the military, then makes the bomb, then detonates it, then reaps the repercussions of guilt. Did it have to be 3 hours. No.That said, it is an achievement in all aspects of cinema. Camera work is sublime. You cannot tell me the depth of which this film exists is subpar to anything superhero staged. This is a grown up film made by grown ups who understand nuance and subtlety. But also stage craft. This is something painfully missing and long forgotten since we all started losing our attention spans. This is something that lingers long after it ends.Now, am I speaking in hyperbolic nature? Yes. However, I only understand that some people who go into this are going to wonder what the big deal will be. The exercise is telling a fascinating tale about a exception human that was tasked to do something exceptional. Does it mirror people who have creativity. In a small way, it does. Some of us out here are creative. Want to tackle the beast, but now have to face the responsibility of our creation.The film does something good though. Though it continues to hammer the idea that he takes credit for creating fire that let man destroy themselves, he never is awarded full responsibility. Oppenheimer knew the pieces that fit that could bring it together. But in his creation also ended generations. In today's political climate, it's hard to sit by that knowledge of killing over 200,000 people and effecting millions later. If you understand the gravity of this, this film will hit hard.",8,Oppenheimer
"It took nine seconds to decimate the city of Hiroshima with just one first generation atom bomb. That was in 1945. Today, and as of January 2023, there are over 12,500 advanced nuclear warheads around the world. Relating that fact to the review of this film, it doesn't matter whether the atom bomb was invented or the ability to split the nucleus of an atom was discovered. If we could put the knowledge of weaponizing atomic energy into a box, lock it and through away the key, we would still have a huge problem; because the name on that box would read - Pandora.Greek mythology also tells us that Pandora was betrothed to Prometheus. Ironically, the Prometheus referred to in this review is the Pulitzer winning autobiography of the titular J. Robert Oppenheimer. Based on American Prometheus, Oppenheimer from revered director Christopher Nolan sets about telling us exactly what the book does, and that is to relive the triumph and tragedy of the 'father of the atom bomb'.True to Nolan's style of presenting an organic puzzle, the narrative is an interview within an interview interconnecting three crucial timelines in Oppenheimer's life. Presented in black and white is the 1959 Senate Confirmation Hearing of the Atomic Energy Commission for Director Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr) who was responsible for defaming Oppenheimer as a traitor, communist and spying for the Russians. Due to this accusation, the AEC hearing begins in 1954 revoking Oppenheimer's security clearance. And the planning and resources leading up to the detonation of the first atom bomb - codenamed Trinity - takes place in 1945. During the constant shift in these timelines, we come across a plethora of characters (from A-list actors) orbiting Oppenheimer like charged neutrons, pun intended. The most important are General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) supervising the Trinity program at the New Mexico desert in Los Alamos. Director Lewis Strauss as a direct threat and rival from the get go. And the women in his life, wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) and mistress Jean (Florence Pugh).Several other important characters weave in and out of his life as a professor of theoretical physics, to heading the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, to his downfall as an all-American hero. During all this time, we are witnessing the slow build-up and moral anguish of a man who used his intellect and charismatic leadership to create something the world has never known before, and then realise that his creation is nothing but the key to end all life as we know it. This epiphany, if we can call it that, comes to Oppenheimer in flashes of vivid and horrific images. But even before that, Oppenheimer's most tortured vision is the materialisation of a Sanskrit verse from the ancient scripture of the Bhagavad Gita - ""I am now become Death, the destroyer of worlds"". With sunken eye sockets and haunting blue eyes looking at a distant but devastating future, Cillian Murphy as the titular Oppenheimer is an instant front-runner come awards season. Not because he ate one almond a day to transform his physical appearance, or because of his brilliant personification of a psychologically tortured character, or because of the cold and unaffected relationship with the women in his life, but because of that short yet powerful scene when those words are spoken.From its very first scene of rain drops creating ripple effects on the puddle of water it falls on, to the very last scene depicting annihilation of all life on Earth, Oppenheimer is an indicator that Nolan defies convention and mediocrity. Despite being overlong at 180 minutes, and seemingly unevenly paced, Oppenheimer is Nolan stepping away from his penchant for action and sci-fi adventure films while getting back to his roots. If you're thinking Memento, you are in for a cerebral experience. Known for making us think, and even question what we see, this is Nolan channelling his magnum opus in not just telling the world what we have deliberately forgotten, but telling it a way we will never forget. With continuous bombardment of facts and figures, theoretical science and application, and historic names behind the nuclear arms development program, it's a marathon of a film to get through, but never dull. The moment every viewer is waiting for comes two hours into the film and turns out to be Nolan's crowning sequence. We first see it, then we hear it. Then, at the very end of the film and during a hair-raising conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein, we feel it in all its wrath. We feel a sunken weight like watching a Greek tragedy unfold - and that is Prometheus stealing fire from Zeus and gifting it to mankind.",9,Oppenheimer
The casting is phenomenal. A lot of people will go just on that basis. Sadly that's the only phenomenal element to the movie. The movie jumps around oddly without creating satisfying tales. There are missed opportunities to create and impact the real scale of the subject matter. This was a pivotal moment in human history but feels almost unremarkable because of how it was told here.Easily l have been 30 mins shorter and cut some of the characters to focus the narrative better. Florence Pugh (thesp darling) was solid & her character got a lot of time (relatively) but felt minor to overall arc and Emily Blunt was excellent but her influence was largely ignored. Some of the scientists where barely mentioned then had major roles to play.Nolan had chance to smash it. Everything was there for him. He dropped the ball (or bomb if you like) and it's just simply a shame. Ah well.,6,Oppenheimer
"Another film where the director is "" Hey look at me how clever I am"" Starting the movie from the middle of the story , then going back to start and back to the middle, short scenes , continually cutting from one scene to another, as if you were watching the trailer. Cringeworthy sex scenes, I really don't want to see a naked man sitting in a chair talking to a naked woman. The film is set in the black and white era of the 30's and 40's so why did we need to alternate from black and white to color? A let down in so many areas and gets drawn out to a 3 hour yawn feast. Had I not gone with friends I would have walked out after 30 minutes. Only saving grace was some good acting performances which is the reason for the two stars. There are many excellent documentaries on Oppenheimer and would certainly recommend you watch one of them instead of this movie.",2,Oppenheimer
